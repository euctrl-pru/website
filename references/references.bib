@article{wickhamTidy,
  Abstract =     {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
                  for analysis, but there has been little research on how to
                  make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This
                  paper tackles a small, but important, component of data
                  cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate,
                  model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each
                  variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type
                  of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy
                  to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are
                  needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This
                  structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data
                  analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The
                  advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools
                  are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data
                  manipulation chores.},

  title =        {Visualising migration flow data with circular plots},
  institution =  {Vienna Institute of Demography},
  year =         {2014},
  abstract =     {Effective visualisations of migration flows can substantially
                  enhance our understanding of underlying patterns and trends.
                  However, commonly used migration maps that show place-to-place
                  flows as stroked lines drawn atop a geographic map fall short
                  of conveying the complexities of human movement in a clear and
                  compelling manner. We introduce circular migration plots, a
                  new method for visualising and exploring migration flow tables
                  in an intuitively graspable way. Our approach aims to provide
                  detailed quantitative information on the intensities and
                  patterns of migration flows around the globe by using a
                  visualization design that is effective and visually appealing.
                  The key elements of the design are (a) the arrangement of
                  origins and destinations of migration flows in a circular
                  layout, (b) the scaling of individual flows to allow the
                  entire system to be shown simultaneously, (c) the expression
                  of the volume of movement through the width of the flow and
                  its direction through the colour of the origin. Drawing on new
                  estimates of 5-year bilateral migration flows between 196
                  countries, we demonstrate how to create circular migration
                  plots at regional and country levels using three alternative
                  software packages: Circos, R, and the JavaScript library
                  d3.js. Circular migration plots considerably improve our
                  ability to graphically evaluate complex patterns and trends in
                  migration flow data, and for communicating migration research
                  to scientists in other disciplines and to the general public.
                  Our visualisation method is applicable to other kinds of flow
                  data, including trade and remittances flows.},
