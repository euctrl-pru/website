### 2. Calculation of terminal unit rates

#### 2.1. The terminal unit rate shall be calculated before the beginning of each year of the reference period.

#### 2.2. It shall be calculated by dividing the forecast number of total Terminal ANS Service Unit for the relevant year into the algebraic sum of the following elements:

* the determined costs of the relevant year,
* the application of the difference between forecasted and actual inflation as referred to in Article 6(1),
* the carry-overs resulting from the implementation of the traffic risk-sharing referred to in Article 11a(2) to (7) ,
* the carry-overs from the previous reference period resulting from the implementation of the cost risk-sharing referred to in Article 11a(8),
* bonuses and penalties resulting from the financial incentives referred to in Article 12(2),
* for the first two reference periods, the over or under recoveries incurred by Member States up to the year preceding the application of this Regulation to terminal charges,
* a deduction of the costs of VFR flights as identified in Article 7(4).
