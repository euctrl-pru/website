The Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) is an Aircraft Performance Model developed and maintained by EUROCONTROL, with the active cooperation of aircraft manufacturers and operating airlines.

The BADA APM is designed for simulation and prediction of aircraft trajectories for purposes of ATM research and operations. Aircraft performance parameters and trajectories can be calculated using information and data contained in BADA.

To replicate reality in both operational and research modelling and simulation systems, each and every real aircraft needs a corresponding aircraft model.

More information is available from the [EUROCONTROL BADA web site](http://www.eurocontrol.int/services/bada){:target="_blank"}.
