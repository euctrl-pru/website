An Arrival Manager system is primarily designed to provide automated sequencing
support for the [ATCO][atco]s handling traffic arriving at an airport, continuously calculating
arrival sequences and times for flights, taking into account the locally defined landing rate,
the required spacing for flights arriving to the runway and other criteria.
