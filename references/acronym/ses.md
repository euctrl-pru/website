The EUâ€™s SES main objective is to reform ATM in Europe in order to cope with
sustained air traffic growth and operations under the safest, most cost-
and flight-efficient and environmentally friendly conditions.
This implies de-fragmenting the European airspace, reducing delays,
increasing safety standards and flight efficiency to reduce the aviation
environmental footprint, and reducing costs related to service provision.
