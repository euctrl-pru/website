The <a href="http://www.eurocontrol.int/dossiers/fabs" target="_blank">FAB</a>
concept was developed in the 1st legislative package of the Single European Sky
(SES I) as one of the main means for reducing airspace fragmentation. The 2nd
legislative package (SES II) tackled the creation of FABs in terms of service
provision, in addition to the airspace organisation issues. 

The twofold objective of the legislative packagers is to optimise air traffic
flows and increase the efficiency of air traffic services in Europe.

SES II lays down a definite commitment date for the Member States to improve
performance by implementing FABs, i.e. 4 December 2012. Nine FAB initiatives
have been taken:

used), please refer to the relevant section in the
