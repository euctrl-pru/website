This directory contains the pages describing why and how the Performance Indicators are calculated.

* why: this is the expected meaning we want to extract from the data, i.e. the rationale for the indicator.
* how: this explains practically what is being performed and the relevant shortcuts/caveats taken to arrive at the numbers produced.
