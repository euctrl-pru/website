## Data description
<p>The ATC pre-departure delay is the additional time that the aircraft is held at the stand to avoid queuing at the departure runway. It is a proxy of the delay which an aircraft ready to leave its gate can be subject to, at its origin airport, due to airports constraints, demand/capacity imbalances known prior to off-blocks, take-off restrictions and/or traffic intensity at the time of operations. It is however to be acknowledged that this indicator does not aim at filtering out push-back delays when these are generated by an apron management unit which is not under the control of the ANS provider.</p>

<p>As per the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 390/2013, Annex I, Section 2, para 3.2, the ATC pre-departure delay is a performance indicator which will be collected for performance monitoring only, at national level with a breakdown at airport level.</p>

As per EU IR390/2013, Annex V, para 3.1.(u), the causes for ATC pre-departure delay means the standard IATA delay codes as defined in Section F of CODA Digest Annual 2011 ‘Delays to Air Transport in Europe’, with the duration of the delay. These delay causes relate to IATA delay Code 89 that aims at capturing off-block delays due to local ATC and push-back when the aircraft is ready to leave its stand. More specifically, these codes aim at reporting restrictions at airport of departure, including Air Traffic Services, start-up and pushback, airport and/or runway closed due to obstruction or weather, industrial action, staff shortage, political unrest, noise abatement, night curfew, special flights.
