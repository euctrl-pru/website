### {% img prcq-traffic.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Traffic' class:'leadimg' %} [Traffic][traffic]

In the first six months of 2018, air traffic in the EUROCONTROL area [(ESRA08)][esra08] grew on average by 3.2% which corresponds to 862 additional flights per day. At the same time, average daily en-route service units (SU) grew by 6.0% between January and June 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. 

Pan-European traffic and flights to and from Europe continued to grow in the first six months of 2018. The main drivers of the observed traffic growth in 2018 (Jan-Jun) were charter flights and the continued growth in the low cost traffic segment.

With the exception of Avinor (Norway), all [Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs)][ansp]  reported a traffic increase in the first half of 2018. In absolute terms, DHMI (Turkey), ENAIRE (Spain), BULATSA (Bulgaria), and DFS (Germany) showed the highest growth in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.

### {% img prcq-operations-enroute.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Operations En-route' class:'leadimg' %} [Operations En-route][ops_ert]

In the first half of 2018, total en-route ATFM delays in the EUROCONTROL area more than doubled (+141%) compared to the same period in 2017. As a result, average en-route ATFM delay per flight increased from 0.64 in 2017 to 1.48 in the first six months of 2018.

The main drivers of the substantial increase observed in the first two quarters of 2018 were en route ATFM regulations attributed to capacity, staffing and adverse weather. Compared to Q1-2 in 2017 there was also a significant increase in ATFM delays due to ATC industrial action in France. 

Overall, 10.5% of the controlled flights in the EUROCONTROL area were affected by ATFM delays in the first half of 2018 (+3.9 percent points vs. 2017).
Compared to 2017, the share of flights affected by en-route ATFM delays increased by 4.0 percent points to 7.9%. At the same time, the share of flights affected by <a href='{{"/prcq/ops-airport.html"| prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}'>airport ATFM delays</a> decreased slightly from 2.7% in 2017 to 2.6% in the first half of 2018.

In the first half of 2018, average en-route delay per flight was highest in France (1.75 min), followed by DFS/Germany (1.5 min) and  Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre/MUAC (0.88 min).

Horizontal en route flight efficiency in the first two quarters of 2018 remained at the level observed in 2017. 

### {% img prcq-operations-airport.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Operations at airports' class:'leadimg' %} [Operations Airport][ops_apt]

Amsterdam remained the airport with the highest number of commercial movements in the EUROCONTROL area in 2018 (Jan-Jun).<br>

Ten of the top 30 airports showed a decrease in traffic in the first six months of 2018 with Dusseldorf (DUS) and Berlin/Tegel (TXL) reporting the most notable traffic reduction compared to the same period in 2017. 

<br>
The highest growth compared to Jan-Jun 2017 was observed at Warsaw (WAW), Lisbon (LIS), Athens (ATH), Helsinki (HEL) and Frankfurt (FRA). 

Average airport ATFM delays at the top 30 European airports decreased from 1.12 to 1.06 minutes per arrival in the first two quarters of 2018. The most notable improvement was observed for Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport (SAW) where ATFM arrival delay reduced by 5.3 minutes compared to the same period in 2017.

<a href='{{"/references/definition/additional_asma_time.html"| prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}'>Additional ASMA time</a> at the top 30 airports increased compared to the first half of 2017 while <a href='{{"/references/definition/additional_taxi-out_time.html"| prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}'>Additional taxi-out time</a> decreased at the top 30 airports during the same period.
