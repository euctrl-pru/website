PRR 2016 presents an assessment of the performance of
[Air Navigation Services (ANS)][ans] in the [EUROCONTROL area][ectl_area] for
the calendar year 2016.The actual financial data relate to 2015, which is the 
latest year for which actual financial data are available.


### {% img prcq-traffic.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Traffic' class:'leadimg' %} [Traffic][traffic]

In 2016, air traffic in the EUROCONTROL area [(ESRA08)][esra08] continued to increase for the third year in a row. 
On average, the number of controlled flights increased by 2.4% compared to 2015. The main driver of the observed 
growth in 2016 was the growth in the intra-European low cost traffic segment. As in previous years, passenger 
numbers grew at a higher rate than traffic (+5.1% vs. 2015). 

In 2016, annual traffic reached the pre-economic crisis level of 2008 and the third quarter in 2016 was the highest on record. 
Of the 39 [Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs)][ansp] included in the analysis, 25 showed an increase in traffic compared 
to 14 [ANSPs][ansp] which showed a decline in 2016. In absolute terms, ENAIRE (Spain), NATS (UK) and DSNA (France) experienced 
the highest year on year growth in 2016. DHMI (Turkey), UKSATSE (Ukraine) and ROMATSA (Romania) reported the highest absolute 
decrease in 2016.

The substantial traffic increase in some areas contributed to a decrease in overall service quality. The share of flights arriving 
within 15 minutes of their scheduled time decreased by 1.6 percent points to reach 81.5% in 2016.

### {% img prcq-safety.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Safety' class:'leadimg' %} [Safety][safety]

Safety is the primary objective of ANS and overall safety levels in the [EUROCONTROL area][ectl_area] remain high. There was 
only one reported air traffic accident with direct ANS contribution in 2015, which is the latest year for which validated data are available.     

With the exception of [Unauthorised Penetrations of Airspace (UPAs)][upa], the number of all key risk occurrence types 
[(Separation minima infringements (SMIs)][smi], [Runway incursions (RIs)][ri], and ATM Specific Occurrences) decreased in the 
[EUROCONTROL area][ectl_area] in 2015, despite the increase in traffic. Overall, there were 15 [SMIs][smi] and 28 [UPAs][upa] 
per hundred thousand controlled flight hours in the airspace and less than one reported [RI][ri] per ten thousand movements in 2015.    

The quality and completeness of safety data reported to EUROCONTROL increased over the past years but with scope for further improvement, 
particularly in terms of severity classification. Although this has been pointed out by the PRC on several occasions, 16% of the reported 
occurrences were still not severity classified in 2015.   

The PRC review of the implementation status of the [Acceptable Level of Safety Performance (ALoSP)][alosp] concept in EUROCONTROL Member 
States clearly suggested that there is a need for common definitions and guidance material in order to ensure a harmonised approach in 
the [EUROCONTROL area][ectl_area].  

### {% img prcq-operations-enroute.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Operations En-route' class:'leadimg' %} [Operations En-route][ops_ert]

The PRC’s concern about over conservative capacity planning and the risk of performance deterioration when traffic grows again has been 
voiced on several occasions. In 2016, total en-route [ATFM delays][ATFM_dly] increased by 21% compared to 2015 and the share of flights 
affected by en-route [ATFM delays][ATFM_dly] increased from 3.9% to 4.8% in 2016. 

ATC Capacity/Staffing related constraints remained by far the main driver of en-route [ATFM delays][ATFM_dly] (55.3%), followed by 
weather-related constraints (18.3%), ATC disruptions/ industrial actions (12.3%) and Event related constraints (9.1%) which also include 
delays due to ATC system upgrades.
Three quarters of the en-route [ATFM delays][ATFM_dly] were generated by four [ANSPs][ansp]: DSNA (41.6%), DFS (13.0%), Maastricht (11.4%) 
and ENAIRE (9%). The vast majority of [Area Control Centres (ACCs)][acc] performed well in 2016, with notable improvements at Lisbon, Athens, 
and Zagreb [ACCs][acc]. The most constraining [ACCs][acc] in 2016 were Brest, Nicosia, Bordeaux, Brussels, Barcelona, Prestwick, Maastricht UAC, 
Warsaw, Canarias, Karlsruhe UAC and Marseille. Together, they accounted for 70.1% of all en-route ATFM delays but only 30.1% of total flight hours 
controlled in the [EUROCONTROL area][ectl_area].

The reasons for the constraints varied by [ACC][acc] and were in some cases exacerbated by the higher than expected traffic growth. In view of 
the number of planned major project implementations over the next years it is important to reiterate the message from last year’s PRR that 
[ANSPs][ansp] need to effectively coordinate the planning and implementation of all changes to the ATM system that could adversely affect operations 
with the [Network Manager][nm].

[Horizontal en-route flight efficiency][hfe] in the [EUROCONTROL area][ectl_area] decreased slightly from 97.3% to 97.1% in 2016, after a continuous 
improvement over the past years. The effects of ATC industrial action on specific days in 2016 are clearly visible but the overall impact on system 
wide flight efficiency remains within 0.03% points.
Despite a slight decrease in flight efficiency at system level in 2016, the benefits of [Free Route Airspace (FRA)][fra] implementation and related 
reductions in fuel burn, emissions and costs are clearly visible in a number of Member States. On average, flight efficiency is 1.6% points better 
in Member States where [FRA][fra] is fully implemented all day, and actual flown trajectories are notably closer to the filed flight plans.  

Complementary to horizontal flight efficiency, an initial evaluation of vertical en-route flight efficiency in this year’s PRR enabled clear 
differences on specific airport pairs to be identified. Work is in progress to better quantify the measured inefficiencies in terms of fuel burn 
and CO2 emissions in the future.

Closer civil-military cooperation and coordination is an important enabler to improve capacity and flight efficiency performance. Some areas for 
further improvement identified in a PRC survey relate to the lack of impact assessment in terms of capacity and route options for restricted/segregated 
airspace and the absence of clear strategic objectives.  

### {% img prcq-operations-airport.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Operations at Airports' class:'leadimg' %} [Operations at Airports][ops_apt]

The analysis of the top 30 airports in terms of traffic showed that ten airports (Amsterdam, Istanbul Ataturk, London Gatwick, Stockholm Arlanda, 
Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen, Dublin, Berlin Tegel, Geneva, Lisbon and Warsaw) reported their highest traffic level on record, surpassing the levels 
observed before the economic crisis starting in 2008. Amsterdam reported a 5.9% increase in traffic in 2016 which made it the airport with the 
most commercial movements in Europe in 2016.  

The two Istanbul airports, which reported a remarkable traffic growth over the past years, were affected by the situation in Turkey, resulting 
in a notable slowdown in traffic growth. Of the top 30 airports, six showed a traffic decrease in 2016 with the highest decrease observed for 
Brussels airport (-6.5% vs 2015) as a result of the reduced capacity following the terrorist attacks in March 2016. 

The substantial traffic increase at some airports contributed to higher levels of operational inefficiency and resulted in somewhat higher 
additional times during descent and in the taxi-out phase compared to 2015. 

Average airport arrival [ATFM delay][ATFM_dly] and [additional holding (ASMA) time][asma_add] decreased slightly in 2016 at the top 30 airports 
but were still heavily concentrated among a few airports. Five airports (Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen, Istanbul Ataturk, Amsterdam, London Heathrow, 
and London Gatwick) accounted for 59% of the airport arrival ATFM delay reported for the top 30 airports. The situation in Istanbul is expected 
to improve with the opening of the first phase of the new Istanbul Airport which is scheduled for 2017/2018. Airport arrival ATFM performance 
at Amsterdam and the two London airports (LHR, LGW) was to a large extent affected by weather which required the available capacity to be reduced. 

London Heathrow, Istanbul Ataturk and Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen show all up with a continuously high arrival throughput close to the peak declared 
arrival capacity. Although this maximises the use of capacity, the high intensity operation close to maximum capacity can result in high delays 
and possibly cancellations when there is a mismatch between scheduled demand and the capacity that can be made available.

The group of smaller Greek airports reported in last year’s report continued to generate high [ATFM delays][ATFM_dly] in 2016. The issue appears 
to be linked to scheduling and variability. It needs to be addressed proactively in order to avoid a repetition of high delays also in summer 2017. 
The PRC will be monitoring the situation which has persisted now for several years. 
Whereas [A-CDM][a_cdm] implementation is considered to be an enabler to improve situation awareness and performance, it is important to ensure that 
the available information is used to improve local processes. [A-CDM][a_cdm] can also help to improve the data quality which is presently an issue 
for the measurement of [ATC pre-departure delays][atc_pre]. 

[Vertical flight efficiency in climbs and descents][vfe_cdo] in climbs and descents at the top 30 airports has been added as a new metric in this 
year’s report. On average, inefficiencies were more than 6 times higher in descent than in climb with notable differences by airport.

### {% img prcq-economics.png magick:resize:50x50 alt:'Economics' class:'leadimg' %} [Economics][economics]

In 2015, which is the latest year for which actual financial data are available, the en-route ANS unit costs of the Pan-European system amounted 
to 49.2 €2009 per service unit (TSU). This is -2.4% lower than in 2014 since in 2015 the number of TSUs rose faster (+3.9%) than en-route ANS costs (+1.5%). 
En-route unit costs are expected to reduce by -1.6% p.a. over the 2015-2019 period and reach a value of 46.1 €2009. If these plans materialise, 
the en-route unit costs in 2019 will be some -23% lower than in 2009, implying substantial cost-efficiency improvements during this 10 year period.

In 2015, European terminal ANS unit costs amounted to 171.6 €2009 per terminal service unit (TNSU) and are expected to decrease by -2.1% p.a. until 2019. 
This performance improvement reflects the fact that total terminal ANS costs are planned to reduce by -0.7% p.a. while TNSUs are expected to increase 
by +1.4% p.a. between 2015 and 2019.

Detailed ANSPs benchmarking analysis indicates that in 2015 gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs increased by +1.7% and amounted to some €8.2 Billion 
at Pan-European system level. At the same time traffic, expressed in terms of [composite flight hours][composite_hr], increased at a slightly higher 
rate (+1.8%). As a result, gate-to-gate unit ATM/CNS provision costs remained fairly constant in 2015 (-0.1% vs 2014).

In order to also consider the service quality provided by ANSPs, the gate-to-gate economic performance combines ATM/CNS provision costs and the 
cost of ATFM delays. Although unit ATM/CNS provision costs remained constant in 2015, unit economic costs increased by +4.2% to reach €505 per 
composite flight-hour reflecting a substantial increase in the unit costs of ATFM delays (+38.7% vs. 2014). 

In fact, the trend of decreasing [ATFM delays][ATFM_dly] observed in previous years stopped in 2013, when a new cycle characterised by higher delays started. 
The analysis provided in the operational en-route ANS performance chapter of this report indicates that this trend continued in 2016 since en-route 
ATFM delays were +20.9% higher than in 2015. This implies that in 2016, the unit costs of delays will be significantly higher than in 2015 and will 
negatively affect ANSPs economic cost-effectiveness.
