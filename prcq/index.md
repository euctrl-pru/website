In 2016, air traffic in the EUROCONTROL area (ESRA08) continued to increase for the third year in a row.
On average, the number of controlled flights increased by 2.4% compared to 2015.
The main driver of the observed growth in 2016 was the growth in the intra-European low cost traffic segment.
As in previous years, passenger numbers grew at a higher rate than traffic (+5.1% vs. 2015).

Although annual traffic in 2016 was still slightly below pre-economic crisis levels in 2008,
the third quarter in 2016 was the highest on record.
Of the 39 Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) included in the analysis, 25 showed an
increase in traffic compared to 14 ANSPs which showed a decline in 2016.
In absolute terms, ENAIRE (Spain), NATS (UK), and DSNA (France) experienced the highest year
on year growth in 2016.
DHMI (Turkey), UKSATSE (Ukraine) and ROMATSA (Romania) reported the highest absolute decrease in 2016.
The substantial traffic increase in some areas contributed to a decrease in overall service quality.
The share of flights arriving within 15 minutes of their scheduled time decreased
by 1.6% points to reach 81.5% in 2016.

{% endfigure %}

Safety is the primary objective of Air Navigation Services and overall safety levels
in the EUROCONTROL area remain high.
There was only one reported air traffic accident with direct ANS contribution in 2015,
which is the latest year for which validated data is available.

With the exception of Unauthorised Penetrations of Airspace (UPAs), the number of all
key risk occurrence types (Separation minima infringements (SMIs), Runway incursions (RIs),
and ATM Specific Occurrences) decreased in the EUROCONTROL area in 2015, despite the increase
in traffic.
Overall, there were 15 SMIs and 28 UPAs per hundred thousand controlled flight hours
in the airspace and 8 RIs per hundred thousand movements at airports in 2015.

The quality and completeness of safety data reported to EUROCONTROL increased over the past
years but with scope for further improvement, particularly in terms of severity classification.
Although this has been pointed out by the PRC on several occasions, 16% of the reported
occurrences were still not severity classified in 2015.

The PRC review of the implementation status of the Acceptable Level of
Safety Performance (ALoSP) concept in EUROCONTROL Member States clearly
suggested that there is a need for common definitions and guidance material
in order to ensure a harmonised approach in the EUROCONTROL area.

The PRC’s concern about over conservative capacity planning and the risk of a performance deterioration
when traffic grows again has been voiced on several occasions.
In 2016, total en-route ATFM delays increased by 20% compared to 2015 and the share of flights affected
by en-route ATFM delays increased from 3.9% to 4.8% in 2016.

ATC Capacity/Staffing related constraints remained by far the main driver of
en-route ATFM delays (55.3%), followed by weather related constraints (18.3%),
ATC disruptions/industrial actions (12.3%), and Event related constraints (9.1%)
which also include delays due to ATC system upgrades.

Three quarters of the en-route delays were generated by four air navigation service providers:
DSNA (41.6%), DFS (13.0%), Maastricht (11.4%), and ENAIRE (9%).
The vast majority of Area Control Centres (ACCs) provided a good performance in 2016 and notable
improvements were observed at Lisbon, Athens, and Zagreb ACCs.
The most constraining ACCs in 2016 were Brest, Nicosia, Bordeaux, Brussels, Barcelona, Prestwick,
Maastricht UAC, Warsaw, Canarias, Karlsruhe UAC, and Marseille.
Together, they accounted for 70.1% of all en-route ATFM delays but only 30.1% of total flight
hours controlled in the EUROCONTROL area.

The reasons for the constraints varied by ACC and were in some cases exacerbated by the higher
than expected traffic growth. In view of the number of planned major project implementations
over the next years it is important to reiterate the message from last year’s PRR
that ANSPs need to effectively coordinate the planning and implementation of all changes
to the ATM system that could adversely affect operations with the Network Manager.

Horizontal en-route flight efficiency in the EUROCONTROL area decreased slightly from 97.3%
to 97.1% in 2016, after a continuous improvement over the past years.
The effects of ATC industrial action on specific days in 2016 are clearly visible but the
overall impact on system wide flight efficiency remains within 0.03% points.
Despite slight decrease in flight efficiency at system level in 2016, the benefits of Free Route Airspace (FRA)
implementation and related reductions in fuel burn, emissions and costs are clearly visible
in a number of Member States.
On average, flight efficiency is 1.6% points better in Member States where FRA is fully implemented
all day and actual flown trajectories are notably closer to the filed flight plans.

Complementary to horizontal flight efficiency, an initial evaluation of vertical en-route
flight efficiency in this year’s PRR enabled to identify clear differences on specific
airport pairs and work is in progress to better quantify the measured inefficiencies
in terms of fuel burn and CO2 emissions in the future.

Close civil military cooperation and coordination has been pointed out as an important enabler
to improve capacity and flight efficiency performance.
Some areas for further improvement identified in a PRC survey relate to the lack of impact
assessment in terms of capacity and route options for restricted/segregated airspace
and the absence of clear strategic objectives.

{% endfigure %}

The analysis of the top 30 airports in terms of traffic showed that nine airports
(Amsterdam, Istanbul Ataturk, London Gatwick, Stockholm Arlanda, Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen,
Dublin, Berlin Tegel, Geneva, Lisbon, and Warsaw) reported their highest traffic level
on record, surpassing the levels observed before the economic crisis starting in 2008.
Amsterdam reported a 5.9% increase in traffic in 2016 which made it the airport with the
most commercial movements in Europe in 2016.

The two Istanbul airports, which reported a remarkable traffic growth over the past years,
were affected by the situation in Turkey, resulting in a notable slowdown in traffic growth.
Of the top 30 airports, six showed a traffic decrease in 2016 with the highest decrease
observed for Brussels airport (-6.5% vs 2015) as a result of the reduced capacity following
the terrorist attacks in March 2016.

The substantial traffic increase at some airports contributed to higher levels of operational
inefficiency and resulted in somewhat higher additional times during descent and in the
taxi-out phase compared to 2015.

Average airport arrival ATFM delay and additional holding (ASMA) time decreased slightly
in 2016 at the top 30 airports but were still heavily concentrated among a few airports.
Five airports (Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen, Istanbul Ataturk, Amsterdam, London Heathrow, and
London Gatwick) accounted for 59% of the airport arrival ATFM delay reported for the
top 30 airports.
The situation in Istanbul is expected to improve with the opening of the first phase of
the new Istanbul Airport which is scheduled for 2017/2018.
Airport arrival ATFM performance at Amsterdam and the two London airports (LHR, LGW)
was to a large extent affected by weather which required reducing the available capacity.

London Heathrow, Istanbul Ataturk, and Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen show all up with a continuously
high arrival throughput close to the peak declared arrival capacity.
Although this maximises the use of capacity, the high intensity operation close to maximum
capacity can result in high delays and possibly cancellations when there is a mismatch
between scheduled demand and the capacity that can be made available.
It is therefore no surprise that those airports show comparatively high levels of inefficiency.

The group of smaller Greek airports reported in last year’s report continued to generate
high ATFM delays in 2016. The issue appears to be linked to scheduling and variability
and needs to be addressed proactively in order to avoid a repetition of high delays also
in summer 2017.
The PRC will be monitoring the situation which now persists for several years.

Whereas A-CDM implementation is considered to be an enabler to improve situation
awareness and performance, it is important to ensure that the available information
is used to improve local processes. A-CDM can also help improving the data quality
which is presently an issue for the measurement of ATC pre-departure delays.

Vertical flight efficiency in climbs and descents at the top 30 airports has been
added as a new metric in this year’s report.
On average, inefficiencies were more than 6 times higher in descent than
in climb with notable differences by airport.

{% endfigure %}

In 2015, which is the latest year for which actual financial data are available,
gate-to-gate ATM/CNS provision costs increased by 1.7% and amounted to some
€8.2 Billion at Pan-European system level.

At the same time traffic, expressed in terms of composite flight hours, increased
at a slightly higher rate (+1.8%), leading to a fairly constant system wide unit
cost in 2015 (-0.1% vs 2014).
Operating costs (including staff, non-staff operating costs and exceptional cost items)
account for some 81% of total ATM/CNS provision costs, and capital-related costs
(cost of capital and depreciation) amount to some 19%.

In order to also consider the service quality provided by ANSPs, the gate-to-gate
economic performance combines ATM/CNS provision costs and the cost of ATFM delay.
Although ATM/CNS provision costs per composite flight hour decreased slightly in 2015,
gate-to-gate unit economic costs increased by +4.2% to reach €505 per composite flight-hour
due to a substantial increase in unit cost of ATFM delays (+38.7% vs. 2014).
This was the first increase in unit economic costs since 2010.

Over the 2010-2014 period, economic costs per composite flight-hour decreased
by -5.4% p.a. in real terms, mainly due to the substantial decreases in unit costs
of ATFM delay (-23.4% p.a.).
Over this period, ATM/CNS provision costs remained close to their 2010 level
(-0.1% p.a.) while the number of composite flight-hours slightly increased (+1.0% p. a.).
