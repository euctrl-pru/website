From April 2017 onwards, the PRC will publish short quarterly briefings so that
high level performance information is available more quickly. The quarterly PRC
reviews are supported by the [Performance Review Unit (PRU) Portal][PRU_portal]
which offers download files for more detailed analysis and also information on
methodologies and definitions.

As the 1st Quarter of 2017 is not yet complete, the current version mirrors key
figures from the [draft final Performance Review Report (PRR 2016)][PRR2016_consult]
which is presently available for consultation.

Stakeholders are invited to provide comments on the draft final PRR 2016 to
[Performance Review Unit (PRU-support@eurocontrol.int)](mailto:PRU-support@eurocontrol.int)
**no later than 07 April 2017**.

We are looking forward to hearing from you!

Yours sincerely,

Ralph Riedle

Chairman
Performance Review Commission
