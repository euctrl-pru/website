For almost 20 years, the independent Performance Review Commission (PRC) has been measuring pan-European ATM performance and making recommendations for improvements. The EUROCONTROL performance review scheme, which began in 1998, was a world-first at the time. Since then, elements have been adopted by ICAO and applied by States worldwide including China, Brazil and Singapore. 

In 2016, the PRC held a series of meetings with stakeholders to listen to their needs and requirements. The purpose was to establish whether the PRC’s main products – the annual Performance Review Report and the annual ATM Cost-effectiveness (ACE) Benchmarking report – were still relevant and useful to stakeholders. The answer was a clear yes but with some change proposals to make the reports more concise and to make information available online earlier. 

From April 2017 onwards, the PRC will publish short quarterly briefings so that high level performance information is available more quickly. The quarterly PRC reviews are supported by the [Performance Review Unit (PRU) Portal][PRU_portal] which offers download files for more detailed analysis and also information on methodologies and definitions. 

As the 1st Quarter of 2017 is not yet complete, the current version mirrors key figures from the [draft final Performance Review Report (PRR 2016)][PRR2016_consult] which is presently available for consultation. 

Stakeholders are invited to provide comments on the draft final PRR 2016 to [Catherine Hennessy](mailto:PRU-support@eurocontrol.int) **no later than 07 April 2017**. 
 
We are looking forward to hearing from you!

Yours sincerely,

Ralph Riedle

Chairman
Performance Review Commission
