From April/May 2017 onwards, the PRC will publish short quarterly briefings so that
high level performance information is available more quickly. 

The quarterly PRC reviews are supported by the [Performance Review Unit (PRU) Portal][PRU_portal]
which offers download files for more detailed analysis and also information on
methodologies and definitions.

Until the first publication in early May 2017, the current version mirrors key figures from 
the draft final Performance Review Report 2016.

Yours sincerely,

Ralph Riedle

Chairman
Performance Review Commission
