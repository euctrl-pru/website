	<p>Welcome to the Performance Review Unit (PRU) web site!</p>

	<p>The PRU is an <em>independent</em> unit established by EUROCONTROL.
	It is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the performance of the European ATM System.
	The unit also supports the independent  <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/node/1737">Performance Review Commission</a> (PRC)
	and makes recommendations to the PRC for performance improvements of the European ATM System on the basis of thorough analyses.</p>

	<p>In order to stimulate and support an informed dialogue between all stakeholders there is a need for a
	<u>consistent</u> and <u>transparent</u> approach to the release of validated performance information
	in an open and standardised format.</p>

	<p>Accordingly, this website aims at providing a wide spectrum of ATM performance related information
	for the benefit of the entire European Air Transport network.
	The PRU is keen to work closely with all interested stakeholders to further improve European ATM performance
	so please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}">contact us</a> ({{ site.owner.email }})
	if you have any questions or suggestions related to our work.</p>
