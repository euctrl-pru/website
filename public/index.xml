      <description>In addition to horizontal flight efficiency, various stakeholders have indicated to be interested in the vertical aspect of flight efficiency as well. The PRU have responded to this need by developing and testing performance indicators addressing vertical flight efficiency for possible use in the future.
The focus in this document is put on vertical flight efficiency during the climb and descent phases of flights rather than during the cruising phase.</description>

      <description>Data description The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the average arrival runway queuing time on the inbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.
It is the difference between the actual ASMA time of a flight and a statistically determined unimpeded ASMA time based on ASMA times in periods of low traffic demand.
When monitoring ASMA performance at airports, it is important to note that the goal is not to reduce ASMA time to the unimpeded reference time - as this could negatively impact on runway throughput - but rather to reduce additional ASMA time and associated fuel burnt to the necessary minimum.</description>

The data is based on IATA delay code 89 [see (IATA 2012) ] which, besides delays caused by local ATC constraints, also includes delays due to late push-back approval and some other reasons which may introduce a certain level of bias. Work is in progress to allow for a better identification of the different causal factors.</description>

      <description>Overview Various methods exist to address the determination of the airport capacity. However, there are only a limited number of empirical approaches addressing the capacity utilisation at airports.
A convenient way to summarise the range of operational capacities (i.e. runway system throughputs) are Capacity Coverage Charts (CCC) (De Neufville and Odoni 2003). While an airport has a theoretical maximum capacity, the practical capacity is considered to be established in order to limit the average delay to a reasonable level.</description>

      <description>The Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) is an Aircraft Performance Model developed and maintained by EUROCONTROL, with the active cooperation of aircraft manufacturers and operating airlines.
The BADA APM is designed for simulation and prediction of aircraft trajectories for purposes of ATM research and operations. Aircraft performance parameters and trajectories can be calculated using information and data contained in BADA.
To replicate reality in both operational and research modelling and simulation systems, each and every real aircraft needs a corresponding aircraft model.</description>

      <description>The Basic Load Index (BLI) and the Peak Load Index (PLI) were defined as indicators that enable to compare airport capacity utilisation.
Schinwald/Hornung (2014) describe a procedure to quantify the level of capacity utilisation comparing two characteristic throughput values. The BLI measures how much of the available capacity is used across the majority of the operating conditions. The PLI) is a measure for the time the airport operates traffic peaks.</description>

      <description>The output measures for ANS provision are, for en‐route, the en‐route flight‐hours controlled and, for terminal ANS, the number of IFR airport movements controlled. In addition to those output metrics, it is important to consider a &amp;ldquo;gate‐to‐gate&amp;rdquo; perspective, because the boundaries used to allocate costs between en‐route and terminal ANS vary between ANSPs and might introduce a bias in the cost‐effectiveness analysis.
For this reason, an indicator combining the two separate output measures for en‐route and terminal ANS provision has been calculated.</description>

      <description>The Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System is used to compare traffic demand with the available capacity of a certain air traffic control (ATC) sector. It is a key enabler of the air traffic flow and capacity management (ATFCM) services during tactical operations (on the day of the flight) and pre-tactical operations (from 1 to 6 days before the flight is airborne).
The ETFMS system has two main functions:

      <description>The quality of service provided by ANSPs has an impact on the efficiency of aircraft operations. The service quality related costs need to be taken into consideration for a full economic assessment of ANSP performance.
The quality of service associated with ATM/CNS provision by ANSPs is, for the time being, assessed only in terms of ATFM delays, which can be measured consistently across ANSPs, can be attributed to ANSPs, and can be expressed in monetary terms.</description>

      <description>The FAB concept was developed in the 1st legislative package of the Single European Sky (SES I) as one of the main means for reducing airspace fragmentation. The 2nd legislative package (SES II) tackled the creation of FABs in terms of service provision, in addition to the airspace organisation issues.
The twofold objective of the legislative packagers is to optimise air traffic flows and increase the efficiency of air traffic services in Europe.</description>

      <description>Please note that additional quality control measures detected a limited number of abnormal flight trajectories starting towards the end of 2015 which were removed by applying an additional filter as of 01 January 2015. Due to this quality improvement, the period January 2015 - May 2016 might differ slightly from older data releases.
Data description Horizontal en-route flight efficiency compares the length of actual or planned flight trajectories to the corresponding “achieved” distance.</description>

      <description>Instrument flight rules (IFR) is one of two sets of regulations governing all aspects of civil aviation aircraft operations; the other is visual flight rules (VFR).
Instrument flight rules are rules and regulations to govern flight under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe. IFR flight depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the flight deck, and navigation is accomplished by reference to electronic signals.</description>

      <description>The Peak Load Index (PLI) and the Basic Load Index (BLI) were defined as indicators that enable to compare airport capacity utilisation.
Schinwald/Hornung (2014) describe a procedure to quantify the level of capacity utilisation comparing two characteristic throughput values. The PLI is a measure for the time the airport operates traffic peaks. The BLI measures how much of the available capacity is used across the majority of the operating conditions.</description>

      <description>An approach to smooth sector workloads by reducing traffic peaks through short-term application of minor ground delays, appropriate flight level capping and exiguous rerouting to a limited number of flights. Short-term ATFCM measures (STAMs) can reduce the complexity of anticipated traffic peaks. FMPs analyse the associated lists of flights to anticipate ATC workload and identify actions to be taken in order to reduce the traffic complexity generated by those flights.</description>

      <description>Data description The additional taxi-out time is a proxy for the average departure runway queuing time on the outbound traffic flow during congestion periods at airports.
It is the difference between the actual taxi-out time of a flight and a statistically determined unimpeded taxi-out time based on taxi-out times in periods of low traffic demand.
When monitoring taxi-out performance at airports, it is important to note that the goal is not to reduce taxi time to the unimpeded reference time - as this could negatively impact on runway throughput - but rather to reduce additional taxi-out time and associated fuel burn to the necessary minimum.</description>

      <description>Data description The PRU, in close collaboration with ANSPs, has defined a set of complexity indicators that can be applied in ANSP benchmarking. The complexity indicators are computed on a systematic basis for each day of the year. The complexity indicators are based on the concept of “interactions” arising when there are two aircraft in the same “place” at the same time. Hence, the Complexity Score is a measure of the potential number of interactions between aircraft defined as the total duration of all interactions (in minutes) per flight-hour controlled in a given volume of airspace.</description>

      <description>Introduction The actual time spent by a flight between its last entry in the ASMA (Entry-time at 40 NM upstream - \(A_\text{LET}\)) and the actual landing time (\(A_\text{ALDT}\)) is denoted ASMA transit time (\(A_\text{TT}\)).
\[ A_\text{TT} = A_\text{LET} - A_\text{ALDT} \]
The unimpeded ASMA time is the ASMA transit time in non congested conditions at arrival airports. The unimpeded ASMA time is used in the calculation of the Arrival sequencing and metering area (ASMA) additional time.</description>

      <description>Cross-Border Arrival Management, also referred to as Extended Arrival Management, is an operational procedure which aims to improve and optimise arrival management operations for major airports.
The aircraft’s holding time at congested airports is cut by reducing their cruising speed during the final en-route phase of flight, several hundred miles away from the airport. In doing so, flight efficiency is increased by reducing the overall fuel burn and CO2 emissions.</description>
