    <div class="article-content">
      <p>This document provides a technical description on the methodology used in the analysis of the
vertical profile of the aircraft’s trajectory during climb and descent phases of flights.
The objective of the methodology is to measure and observe vertical flight efficiency without
highlighting specific reasons for the observed behaviour. More detailed case studies are needed
to find out reasons for particular observations.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The main assumption for the analysis of vertical flight efficiency during climb
and descent is that, all other factors being equal, level flight is considered
as inefficient.
The methodology presented here is very similar for the climb and descent phases
so the results for the climb and descent phases are directly comparable.</p>
<div id="general-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>General overview</h3>
<p>The analysis is performed in 5 major steps. First, the trajectory data has to
be loaded into the analysis software.
Then the climb or descent part is identified in these trajectories.
In these parts of the trajectories the level segments are detected and saved
and additional filters are applied.
The next step is the determination of the Top of Climb or Top of Descent.
Finally, the results are calculated and processed for presentation.
This process is visualised in Figure 1.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="loading-of-the-trajectories-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Loading of the trajectories information</h3>
<p>The data used for the analysis are downloaded from the PRISME database.
<a href="../../../reference/acronym/cpf/" title="CPF">CPF</a> data is used in order to assess the actually flown trajectories.</p>
<p>The most important data fields that are of interest for the analysis are
the altitude, position (latitude and longitude) and time information.</p>
</div>
<div id="identification-of-the-climb-or-descent-part-of-the-flight" class="section level3">
<h3>Identification of the climb or descent part of the flight</h3>
<p>For each flight, the climb part is defined as the part of the trajectory before
the Top of Climb (ToC) and the descent part as the part of the trajectory after
the Top of Descent (ToD).</p>
<p>Optimal climb and descent parts until/from the cruising altitude generally
require less than 200NM of track distance from/until the airport, especially
when the cost index is low or high for respectively the climb and
descent <span class="citation">(Airbus <a href="#ref-airbus-cost-index">1998</a>; Peeters <a href="#ref-sam-thesis">2013</a>)</span>.
With this in mind, the analysis is limited to the parts of the trajectories
within a 200NM radius around the departure/arrival airport.
This is to avoid including into the analysis climbs during the cruise phase
which are used to optimise the flight altitude to account for the reducing
weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>The identification method of the climb or descent part corresponds strongly
to the method proposed by the CCO/CDO Task Force and is further detailed below.
It should be noted that the CCO/CDO Task Force uses a 300NM radius for the
climbs instead of 200NM as used in this analysis.
The reasons for choosing a 200NM radius for the climb are threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Having the same radius for both the climb and descent analysis enables a
direct comparison between the climb and descent results; and</p></li>
<li><p>Examination of aircraft trajectories showed that when a radius of 300NM is
used, a lot of level flight at slightly lower altitudes than the cruising
altitude is detected as inefficient, while this could be a consequence of
the optimisation of the cruising altitude with respect to the aircraft’s
weight. This type of level flight should not be seen as being inefficient
and can influence the final results significantly in such a way that the
results are not representative; and</p></li>
<li><p>300NM was chosen by the CCO/CDO Task Force because some very heavy aircraft
could not be able to reach the cruising altitude within a 200NM radius.
Nevertheless, it is preferred to have a stable methodology that suits best
the behaviour of most of the flights and provides statistically correct
results and analyses.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="identification-of-the-climb-part-of-a-flight" class="section level3">
<h3>Identification of the climb part of a flight</h3>
<p>For each flight, the 4D point where the flight crosses the 200NM radius around
the departure airport (for the first time) is determined. This point is defined
as D200. Within the part of the trajectory from take-off until D200 included,
the first 4D point at which the aircraft reaches the highest altitude is
defined as the ToC-D200.
If the aircraft is still climbing when passing the 200NM radius, D200 and
ToC-D200 are the same.</p>
<p>The climb phase is considered to start at 3000 feet AGL since the Noise
Abatement Departure Procedures (NADP) defined by ICAO end at this altitude
<span class="citation">(ICAO <a href="#ref-icao:8168">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, the part of the trajectory considered for the analysis goes from 3000
feet AGL (included) until ToC-D200.</p>
<p>The CCO/CDO Task Force uses 2500 feet as lower limit which is chosen in
relation to the availability of trajectory data.</p>
</div>
<div id="identification-of-the-descent-part-of-a-flight" class="section level3">
<h3>Identification of the descent part of a flight</h3>
<p>For each flight, the 4D point where the flight crosses the 200NM radius around
the destination airport (for the last time) is determined.
This point is defined as A200. Within the part of the trajectory from A200
included until touchdown, the last 4D point at which the aircraft leaves
the highest altitude is defined as the ToD-A200.</p>
<p>The descent phase is considered to end at 1800 feet AGL because the
interception altitude for ILS systems is generally at or above this altitude.
Using 1800 feet AGL as lower limit allows capturing the level segments before
ILS interception but on the other hand disregarding the trajectory below 1800
feet AGL where the aircraft are on the ILS glideslope and no level segments
should occur.</p>
<p>Overall, the part of the trajectory considered for the analysis goes from
ToD-A200 until 1800 feet AGL (included).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="detection-of-the-level-segments" class="section level2">
<h2>Detection of the level segments</h2>
<p>In the climb or descent parts of the trajectories the level segments should be
determined. The trajectory part between two points on that trajectory is
considered as level when the trajectory stays within a fictional window as can
be seen in Figure <a href="#fig:vfe-cd-figure-002">2</a>.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:vfe-cd-figure-002"></span>
<img src="../../../images/vfe-cd-figure-002.png" alt="Rolling window for level segment detection." width="500px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Rolling window for level segment detection.
</p>
</div>
<p>This window has temporal and altitude dimensions related to a specific vertical
velocity that is considered to be the limit between level flight and
climb/descent.
After consultation in the CCO/CDO Task Force, this vertical velocity is chosen
to be 300 feet per minute. Consequently, the dimensions of the window have to
adhere to the following relationship:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{Y}{X} = 300 \  \textrm{feet per minute}
\]</span></p>
<p>E.g. when a temporal size of 10 seconds is used, the window is 50 feet high.
In this case the altitude information of the climb or descent trajectory is
considered at every interval of 10 seconds.
However, since the CPF data are a discrete representation of the actual
trajectories, the necessary altitude information is not available for every
required time instance.
Because of this and whenever required, a linear interpolation is done to obtain
the information needed for the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="toctod-determination" class="section level2">
<h2>ToC/ToD determination</h2>
<p>In order to avoid considering level segments that happen slightly below the
cruising altitude of a flight, an exclusion box is defined.
The exclusion box ranges from the altitude of ToC-D200 or ToD-A200 down to 90%
of this altitude. When a level segment is detected inside the exclusion box and
it lasts longer than 5 minutes, it is not considered in the final results.
The new top of climb or top of descent is in that case put at the start of
(the first of) such segment(s) for climbs or at the end of (the last of) such
segment(s) for descents. This new ToC or ToD is called respectively ToC-CCO or
ToD-CDO. When no level segments longer than 5 minutes are detected inside the
exclusion box, ToC-CCO/ToD-CDO coincides with ToC-D200/ToD-A200.</p>
<p>The determination of the ToC-CCO or ToD-CDO corresponds as well to the CCO/CDO
Task Force’s approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="processing-of-the-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Processing of the results</h2>
<p>The final results are calculated taking into account all level segments before
ToC-CCO for the climbs and after ToD-CDO for the descents.</p>
<p>The results of the analysis include the total number of flights, the average
value and median value of the distance flown level, the percentage of distance
flown level with respect to the total climb or descent distance, the average
value and median value of the time flown level, the percentage of time flown
level with respect to the total climb or descent time and the average value
and median value of the number of level segments.</p>
<p>An additional metric is the median CDO/CCO altitude. This metric is calculated
by taking the altitude of the lowest level segment for each flight.
This information is then aggregated by taking the median value over all
considered flights.
The rationale for using the lowest level segment is the following.
It is best to have no level flight because this increases the fuel burn.
However, if needed, the higher the level segment occurs, the better because
the higher the level segment occurs, the lower the fuel burn.
E.g. a level segment of a fixed duration at FL100 burns more fuel than at
FL300. So, the lowest level segment is considered since it has the
highest environmental impact.</p>
<p>In addition, each flight can be assessed as being CCO (Continuous Climb
Operations) or CDO (Continuous Descent Operations). The fact whether a
flight is considered as being CCO or CDO depends on the allowed amount of
level segments and their allowed lengths or durations.</p>
<p>The formulas used for the calculation of all these results are shown in Table <a href="#tab:formulas">2</a>.</p>
