    <div class="article-content">
      <div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The actual time spent by a flight between its last entry in the
<a href="../../../reference/acronym/asma/">ASMA</a> (Entry-time at 40 NM upstream -
<span class="math inline">\(A_\text{LET}\)</span>) and the actual landing time
(<a href="../../../reference/acronym/aldt/"><span class="math inline">\(A_\text{ALDT}\)</span></a>) is denoted
<a href="../../../references/definition/asma_transit_time/"><em>ASMA transit time</em></a>
(<span class="math inline">\(A_\text{TT}\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A_\text{TT} = A_\text{LET} - A_\text{ALDT}
\]</span></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../reference/definition/unimpeded_asma_time/"><em>unimpeded ASMA time</em></a> is the
ASMA transit time in non congested conditions at arrival airports.
The unimpeded ASMA time is used in the calculation of the
<a href="../../../reference/definition/additional_asma_time/">Arrival sequencing and metering area (ASMA) additional time</a>.</p>
<p>This technical note describes the methodology used in order to calculate the
unimpeded ASMA time.</p>
</div>
<div id="general-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>General approach</h2>
<p>The computation of the unimpeded ASMA time is based on the statistical analysis
of flights in non congested conditions.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether a flight is unimpeded or not, its <em>congestion level</em>
is computed as the number of other aircraft ahead in the arrival queue,
i.e. the number of aircraft that landed between the time the flight under
consideration crossed the ASMA border and its own landing.</p>
<p>The graphic here below illustrates the evolution of the ASMA transit time as a
function of the congestion level. In this picture, the range between the first
quartile (bottom bar of each rectangle), third quartile (top bar) and the median
(medium line) is depicted for each level of congestion.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:saturationlevel"></span>
<img src="../../../images/saturationlevel.jpg" alt="Congestion level vs. saturation level." width="400px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Congestion level vs. saturation level.
</p>
</div>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:saturationlevel">1</a>, as soon as a certain level of congestion
is reached (at
the inflection point of the curve), the ASMA transit time increases linearly
with the level of congestion (red line passing through the origin). Beyond that
inflection point, the ASMA transit time is directly proportional to the number
of aircraft ahead. At a low level of congestion (before the inflection point),
the ASMA transit time tends to be constant (horizontal red line). This constant
ASMA transit time is considered to be the unimpeded time required by any flight
to approach and land on the runway from the ASMA border. The intersection
between the two red lines corresponds to the <em>saturation level</em>.</p>
<p>The greater the level of congestion compared to the saturation level, the
greater the likelihood of a flight’s being delayed due to traffic ahead.
Therefore, to ensure that a flight is unimpeded, its congestion level needs to
be sufficiently small compared to the saturation level. However, it needs to be
ensured that the flight sample is big enough to produce a robust estimate of
unimpeded ASMA time. Considering a flight as unimpeded if its congestion level
is smaller than 50% of the saturation level has proved to be a good compromise
between this two conflicting facts.</p>
<p>Night flights may be subject to special procedures that are not representative
of daytime operations. In addition, when the airport is subject of a curfew, the
first flights in the morning might be delayed in order to land after the curfew
end time. In order to avoid that both night flights and ‘first post-curfew’
flights bias the traffic sample, flights between 6:30 and 22:00 only are used
for the calculation of unimpeded ASMA time.</p>
<p>A different unimpeded ASMA time is determined for each combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>landing runway;</li>
<li>angular sector in which the flight enters the ASMA cylinder; and,</li>
<li>aircraft class;</li>
</ul>
<p>Although unimpeded ASMA time is relatively static in time, regular checks are
made to ensure that it remains representative of the operations for the airport
under consideration. In case a change of unimpeded time is detected, the causes
of that change (new procedure implementation, change of TMA design) are
investigated. When required, new unimpeded times are calculated. However,
because this method is based on statistical analysis of the actual ASMA transit
time, a period of several months after the change is required before new robust
unimpeded times can be established.</p>

<div id="methodological-assumptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Methodological assumptions</h3>
<p>In this methodology, it is assumed that</p>
<ul>
<li>priority is given to approaches rather than departures and, consequently,
departures do not affect congestion level for unimpeded ASMA time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="input-data-required" class="section level3">
<h3>Input data required</h3>
<p>The following input data are required in order to calculate the actual ASMA transit time:</p>

<div id="aircraft-classification" class="section level3">
<h3>Aircraft Classification</h3>
<p>Because aircraft have different approach performances, aircraft are classified,
based on their ICAO designator, into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy (H),</li>
<li>Medium Jet (MJ),</li>
<li>Medium Turbo Prop (MT),</li>
<li>Light jet (LJ),</li>
<li>Light turbo prop (LT), and</li>
<li>Light piston (LP).</li>
</ul>
<p>In most of the cases helicopters do not interfere with other traffic. It was
however experienced, in some cases, that helicoper traffic had to follow the
published procedures and be sequenced with other aircraft. In order not to
consider a flight that could be delayed by preceding helicopter traffic as
unimpeded, helicopter movements are counted in the congestion index. Helicopter
movements are however not counted in the computation of the throughput used for
the saturation level.</p>
</div>
<div id="determination-of-the-asma-entry-sectors" class="section level3">
<h3>Determination of the ASMA entry sectors</h3>
<p>For a given runway configuration, the ASMA transit time depends on the direction
from which the ASMA cylinder is entered. For this reasons the ASMA cylinder is
divided into <em>ASMA sectors</em>. The ASMA sectors are defined further to statistical
clustering analysis of traffic distribution, as illustrated here below.</p>

<h3>Unimpeded ASMA time calculation</h3>
<p>Unimpeded ASMA times are calculated in five steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Input data quality check
<ul>
<li>Landing times and ASMA-entry points are cross-checked for consistency and
completeness, as described in the
[[#Quality assessment|Quality assessment]] section here below.</li>
<li>Detection and filtering of statistical outliers:</li>
<li>Flights with a transit time longer than 120 minutes are removed from the sample.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each arrival flight of the traffic sample
<ul>
<li>Computation of the transit time between the ASMA entry-point and the actual
landing time (ALDT).</li>
<li>Determination of the congestion level by counting the number of other
landings during the time interval ASMA entry time,
ALDT of the respective flight.</li>
<li>Determination of the arrival throughput (total number of landings at the
airport) observed in the hour preceding the the actual landing time (ALDT).</li>
<li>Determination of the triplet (arrival runway, aircraft class, ASMA sector)
which the respective flight belongs to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Determination of the saturation level
<ul>
<li>Estimation of the peak arrival throughput (<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>) of the airport using the 90th
percentile of the arrival throughput within the preceding hour of all
flights in the reference sample.
For each triplet (arrival runway, aircraft class, ASMA sector):
<ul>
<li>Computation of a first unimpeded ASMA time estimate (<span class="math inline">\(U1\)</span>) using the 20th
percentile of all the ASMA transit times of the flights belonging to that
triplet.</li>
<li>Computation of the saturation level (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>):
<span class="math display">\[ L = U1 * R / 60 \]</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identification of the unimpeded flights
For each triplet (arrival runway, aircraft class, ASMA sector):
<ul>
<li>Selection of flights with a <span class="math inline">\(\text{congestion index} &lt;= 0.5 * \text{saturation level}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Computation of the unimpeded time
For each triplet (arrival runway, aircraft class, ASMA sector):
<ul>
<li>If the number of unimpeded flights in the group is less than 20, no
unimpeded ASMA time is computed for that triplet;</li>
<li>If the number of unimpeded flights is greater or equal to 20, the unimpeded
time for this triplet is defined as the median of the observed transit
times of the unimpeded flights.</li>

<li><p>Evolution of the additional ASMA time with the congestion level*
In order to be able to consolidate in a single graph for a given airport with
different triplet (arrival runway, aircraft class, ASMA sector) and different
saturation levels, the data has to be normalised.</p>
<p>For this reason a <span class="math inline">\(\text{congestion index}\)</span> is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{congestion index}  = 100 * \frac{\text{congestion level}}{\text{saturation level}}\]</span></p>
<p>A value of 100 of the congestion index corresponds to a saturation level
independent of arrival runway and ASMA Sector.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4: Evolution of the additional time with the congestion level.
</p>
</div>
As a function of the congestion index, the <em>additional ASMA times</em> should:
<ul>
<li>remain close to zero for low level of congestion (congestion index smaller than 100), and</li>
<li>increase linearly for congestion index greater than 100.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="unimpeded-asma-times-monitoring" class="section level3">
<h3>Unimpeded ASMA times Monitoring</h3>
<p><em>Additional ASMA times</em> for unimpeded flights should remain close to zero. A
change in the unimpeded time might indicate a change in operational procedures
or a re-design of the TMA during the reference period under consideration. In
such a case, new unimpeded ASMA times will be calculated in order to consider
the impact of these changes.</p>

<img src="../../../images/check2.jpg" alt="Verification of monthly statistics." width="300px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5: Verification of monthly statistics.
</p>
</div>
<p>Every month the following checks are carried out for each airport:</p>
<ul>
<li>The percentage of flight with valid data and associated unimpeded times should
remain greater than 90%.</li>
<li>For unimpeded flights,
<ul>
<li>the median of the <em>Additional ASMA times</em> distribution should remain within
the interval <span class="math inline">\(]-1\ \text{minute}, +1\ \text{minute}[\)</span>,</li>
<li>the standard deviation of the <em>Additional ASMA times</em> distribution should be
smaller than 3 minutes, and</li>
<li>P75-P25 should be smaller than 3 minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If one of these conditions is not met, reasons for the changes are investigated
and new unimpeded ASMA times are calculated if required.</p>
