<h1>Conceptual model</h1>
<div id="what-we-ideally-would-like-to-measure" class="section level2">
<h2>What we ideally would like to measure</h2>
<p>On the conceptual level, the indicator aims to address the operational penalty
associated with techniques used to maximize runway utilisation for inbound
traffic flows at an airport, i.e.Â the accumulation of additional approach time
resulting from speed control, path stretching and circling in the vicinity of
the airport (use of holding patterns/stacks).</p>
</div>
<div id="concept-of-runway-optimisation" class="section level2">
<h2>Concept of runway optimisation</h2>
<p>When aircraft cannot fly unimpeded 4D trajectories, there are generally three
places at which queuing takes place, as illustrated in the Figure <a href="#fig:adasma-01">1</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>At the departure stand (pre-departure queuing to optimise network
performance)</li>
<li>At the departure runway (take-off queuing, e.g.Â runway holding)</li>
<li>In the arrival terminal airspace (arrival queuing in the Arrival Sequencing
and Metering Area or ASMA, using speed control, stacks, holding, extension of
approach path etc.)</li>
</ol>

<img src="../../../images/adasma-01.png" alt="Outbound and Inbound Traffic Queues from a Flight Phase Perspective." width="500px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Outbound and Inbound Traffic Queues from a Flight Phase Perspective.
</p>
</div>
<p>Uncertainty of approach conditions (e.g.Â pilot performance, landing clearance
time, approach speed, wind conditions) makes traffic supply to runways a
stochastic phenomenon.</p>
<p>In order to ensure continuous traffic demand at runways and maximise runway
usage, a minimum level of queuing is required. A certain extent of arrival
queuing in airspace is necessary to allow arrival management (sequencing and
metering) to optimise runway utilisation when demand is at or near the
operational capacity.</p>
<p>However, additional time in holding is detrimental to operations efficiency,
fuel consumption and environment. Therefore, a trade-off exists between approach
efficiency and runway throughput.</p>
<p>Optimisation of the runway utilisation may require:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Re-sequencing the take-off/ landing order at the runway (first come is not
first served), and</li>
<li>buffering a sufficient number of aircraft in the queue to be able to fine
tune the metering (to optimise the separation of aircraft released from the
queue to the runway.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases some aircraft will suffer a certain penalty in terms of queuing
time. Higher runway utilisation targets may require higher levels of departure
(take-off) queuing in the manoeuvring area and arrival queuing in airspace. This
effect can be reduced if aircraft are already delivered to the queue in the
right sequence and at the required time intervals.</p>
<p>To reduce cost and environmental impact, the departure and arrival queuing time
should be kept to the minimum needed to achieve the selected runway utilisation
objectives. If possible, any departure and arrival delay that is needed for
other reasons than sequencing and metering should therefore be absorbed at the
departure stand through ATFM delays and local ATC pre-departure delay. If this
is done properly, then measuring outbound and inbound queuing time allows
assessing the âoperational costâ associated with sequencing and metering in
function of the selected runway utilisation objectives.</p>
</div>
<div id="conceptual-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Conceptual approach</h2>
<p>The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the management of the arrival flow,
understood as the average arrival runway queuing time on the inbound traffic
flow, during periods of congestion at airports.</p>
<p>Performance in terms of additional ASMA time is monitored on the basis of
regular reporting in comparison to a nominal reference. Based on regular
reporting, metrics are derived for the respective reporting month. The current
measurements are compared to a nominal reference to address the level of
efficiency. The reference is derived from the statistical analysis of a
reference period sample. This approach is depicted in Figure <a href="#fig:adasma-02">2</a>.

</div>
<p>The indicator is defined, see Equation <a href="#eq:AcASMA">(1)</a>, as the difference between the
ASMA transit time (actual
ASMA time) and the unimpeded ASMA time, based on ASMA transit times in periods
of low traffic.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:AcASMA">\[
\begin{equation} 
textrm{Actual ASMA Time} = textrm{Unimpeded ASMA Time} + textrm{Additional ASMA Time}
\tag{1}
\end{equation} 
\]</span></p>
<p>The unimpeded reference time is determined based on a statistical analysis of
historic data observed at the airport, averaged for groupings of similar
flights. The additional ASMA time is a measure for the extent of which the
actual ASMA time exceeds the unimpeded reference.</p>

<div id="logical-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Logical model</h1>
<p>This section describes the underlying logical modelling and drives the
implementation of the additional ASMA time algorithm.</p>
<div id="assumptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <strong>additional ASMA time</strong> indicator is to provide an
approximate measure of the <strong>average inbound queuing time</strong> on the inbound
traffic flow, during times that the airport is congested.</p>
<p>The calculation of this indicator is based on generalised ASMA area defined
around an airport. Aircraft are subject to the management of the arrival flow
upon entering the ASMA area. Accordingly, the time spent within the ASMA area,
i.e.Â the time elapsing between entering the ASMA area (actual ASMA entry time,
ET) and the actual landing time of an arriving flight (ALDT). The generalised
ASMA area is defined by a cylinder of radius 40NM around the airport extending
to unlimited in terms of altitude.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:adasma-03"></span>
<img src="../../../images/adasma-03.png" alt="Conceptual approach for Additional ASMA Time." width="450px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Conceptual approach for Additional ASMA Time.
</p>
</div>
<p>Actual ASMA time refers to the period between the point in time when the
aircraft enters the ASMA cylinder for the last time (âentry timeâ) and the
landing time. This ensures a consistent measurement for the inbound flow in the
40 NM around an airport. The additional time is measured as the average
additional time beyond the unimpeded ASMA time, which is a statistically
determined reference time based on actual ASMA times in periods of low traffic
demand.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The indicator is currently defined for a radius of 40 NM to allow for
comparability across Europe. For monitoring purposes, a supporting metric
considering a radius of 100NM is calculated by PRU (the 40/100NM positions and
timestamps are calculated from data feeds the Network Manager receives from
member states.)</p>
<p>This indicator excludes influence of the following factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Impact of noise management and terrain clearance aspects: the same effects
are included in both the impeded and unimpeded transit times; therefore this
does not show up in the additional time which is the difference between
impeded and unimpeded.</p></li>
<li><p>Effect of runway friction deteriorations: periods with such conditions are
excluded. The calculation algorithm does not explicitly take any weather
conditions into account.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="grouping-of-flights" class="section level2">
<h2>Grouping of flights</h2>
<p>To reduce the number of combinations of unique entry points and arrival runway,
arriving flights entering the ASMA area within certain limits are grouped
together. The clustering is based on observed arrival flows (i.e.Â crossing of
flown trajectory with the ASMA cylinder).</p>
<p>The result of this clustering yields the <strong>ASMA sectors</strong> and may not be
confused with the actual TMA or approach sectors around the airport. Each ASMA
sector covers a major arrival flow, and the extent of the sector is based on
visualization of arrival radar tracks (see Figure <a href="#fig:adasma-sectors">4</a>)
and the aforementioned entry points.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4: ASMA sectors and bearing.
</p>
</div>
<p>The indicator is first calculated at disaggregated level, i.e.Â per comparable
<strong>grouping</strong> of flights with the same combination of <strong>ASMA sector</strong>, <strong>landing
runway</strong> and <strong>aircraft class</strong>. Each grouping of flights has an unimpeded
reference associated.</p>
<p>Taking the weighted average of the values for all groups produces the ASMA
additional time for the airport.</p>

<div id="logical-approach-to-unimpeded-asma-time-calculation" class="section level2">
<h2>Logical approach to Unimpeded ASMA Time calculation</h2>
<p>The unimpeded ASMA time for each flight is taken from the unimpeded reference
tables. These are calculated by averaging the actual ASMA time for the unimpeded
flights from a reference sample (e.g.Â one year worth of data). The basis of the
algorithm is to determine which flights are unimpeded.</p>
<p>The unimpeded ASMA time corresponds to the ASMA time that an aircraft of a given
triplet, aircraft type â entry sector â runway combination, would spend if no
additional sequencing time would be added, i.e., if the operation would be
unimpeded. The unimpeded times are calculated from a reference data set, and
their values are constant for each triplet combination.</p>
<p>The process steps are described below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The flights with no data or with wrong data are filtered;</li>
<li>Actual ASMA time and congestion level are calculated per flight;</li>
<li>For each flight and flight groupings of same aircraft type â entry sector â
runway combination, calculate the saturation level per grouping;</li>
<li>From these flights, determine which flights are unimpeded by comparing
congestion level and saturation level, for each grouping of flights with a
different AC â SEC â RWY combination;</li>
<li>The unimpeded time is calculated as the median of all flights in the grouping
of combinations AC-SECRWY, for groupings that have at least 20 unimpeded
flights. No unimpeded reference time is calculated for the groupings that
have less than 20 unimpeded flights. Night flights are excluded.</li>

<p>As part of the manual quality analysis of the results, the unimpeded times are
recalculated every month to investigate whether there are any changes in
unimpeded times. Changes at the airport and the airspace design can have an
impact on the unimpeded times. Only in the cases that the substantial changes
are reported for an airport, the differences will be investigated with the
particular airport. If the change is due to a change in the airport
characteristics that require a new performance reference, the reference
unimpeded times will be modified accordingly.</p>

recalculated based on June 2014 are significantly different from the 2011
ones), the issue will be investigated and discussed with the airport, in order

a new runway opened in June 2014, the new reference will be the following
year: June 2014-June 2015. However, if the difference corresponds to a runway
closure of 3 months, the reference would be modified only for the affected 3
months.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two parameters can trigger the renewal of the unimpeded time reference for one
airport, each month:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The NM data flow also provides the calculated landing times (from both
CPR and CTFM). Given the quality assurance measures defined for the airport
operator data flow, NM data flow based timestamps will only be used for
complementing the airport operator data flow.</p>

<h2>The Airport Operator Data Flow process</h2>
<p>The airport operator data flow (APDF) comprises all data collection, processing,
and performance indicator calculation sub-processes. Reporting entities (
i.e.Â airport operators) submit their data to EUROCONTROL on a monthly basis and in
compliance with the APDF data specification.</p>
<p>Several activities are performed in the data flow process, involving different
actors, until Performance reports are published. As a summary, a high level
overview of the activities can be found below:</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The airport operator data flow can be conceptualised as stages sub-processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>APDF_1 â Data Collection</li>
<li>APDF_2 â Data Validation</li>
<li>APDF_3 â Data Extract, Transform and Load</li>
<li>APDF_4 â Data Merging</li>
<li>APDF_5 â Pre-Computation of performance parameters</li>
<li>APDF_6 â Calculation of Performance Indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the sub-processes are governed by quality assurance measures. The PRU
assumes responsibility for the whole flow in terms of quality assurance. Data
collection and initial validation is performed by CODA. Once the data is loaded,
the data processes within the EUROCONTROL data warehouse are managed by PRISME.
In the final stage, PRU extracts the relevant data and computes the performance
metrics and indicators.</p>
<p>APDF related documentation is published under the PRU Quality Management System.</p>
</div>
<div id="quality-assurance-framework" class="section level2">
<h2>Quality Assurance Framework</h2>
<p>Quality assessment on airport data flow process is focused towards implementing
a Quality Assurance Framework based on the ISO 9001 standard. The airport
operator data flow process includes several data processing activities, starting
from the moment flight information is provided by the reporting entity until
performance reports are released.</p>
<p>Standard Operating Procedures for all these sub-processes have been established
and is quality controlled.</p>
<p>The documentation is published under the PRU Quality Management System.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-quality-checks" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Quality Checks</h2>
<p>For the APDF the following quality areas have been identified. Quality controls
in support of these quality areas are implemented and regularly monitored as
part of the aforementioned APDF sub-processes.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>More detail on these quality checks can be found in the Airport Data Flow Data Specifications (see [3]).</p>
</div>
<div id="performance-indicator-quality-checks" class="section level2">
<h2>Performance Indicator Quality Checks</h2>
<p>The average additional ASMA time per flight grouped by airport and month
represents the main result from the performance indicator calculation process.
In addition, this process provides parameters that are used for data validation
and statistical analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>average unimpeded time</p></li>
<li><p>standard deviation</p></li>
<li><p>Values for 25%,50% and 75% percentiles</p></li>
<li><p>number of flights, number of unimpeded flights and number of flights with
valid data</p></li>
<li><p>total additional time, unimpeded time and 25%, 50% and 75% percentile</p></li>
<li><p>completeness and coverage of the traffic sample</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics are used for PRU internal validation activities and may trigger
case-by-case analyses if significant variations are observed.</p>
