      <title>Borealis HFE Analysis</title>

      <description>Borealis is an alliance of nine ANSPs which combined provide air traffic services for over 3.8 million flights1 a year, across 12.5 million \(km^2\) of North European airspace, accounting for 38% of European traffic.
By 2021 Borealis members will have put in place a seamless and integrated freeroute airspace (FRA) extending from the eastern boundary of the North Atlantic to the western boundary of Russian airspace, enabling airline and business aviation customers to take the most cost effective, fuel efficient and timely routes across the three Functional Airspace Blocks (FABs) and Iceland2 within the airspace managed by the members of the Alliance.</description>

      <title>Vertical Flight Efficiency During Climb and Descent</title>
      <link>/study/cco-cdo/</link>

      <description>In addition to horizontal flight efficiency, various stakeholders have indicated to be interested in the vertical aspect of flight efficiency as well. The PRU have responded to this need by developing and testing performance indicators addressing vertical flight efficiency for possible use in the future.
The focus in this document is put on vertical flight efficiency during the climb and descent phases of flights rather than during the cruising phase.</description>

      <description>Explore IFR flights flows between Eurocontrol Member States grouped as per STATFOR regions for the period 2001 - 2015.
Click on a region to discover flows country-by-country. Hover on a region, country or flow in order to get the number of movements. A circular plot of the flows to/from Eurocontrol Member States is available as a separate study.

      <description>Explore IFR flights flows between Eurocontrol Member States and other regions/countries for the period 2001 - 2015.
Click on a region to discover flows country-by-country. Hover on a region, country or flow in order to get the number of movements. A circular plot of the flows internal to Eurocontrol Member States is available as a separate study.
 by Enrico Spinielli (data processing and visualization) &amp;amp; Muriel Tholome (raw data provision)      &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;        Estimating extra-European flight flows  The flows above are about the extra-European flights for the years 2001-2015 which do not originate and arrive in one of the Eurocontrol member States&#39; airports: internal flight flows have been filtered out because their much bigger size would otherwise mask the extra-European ones.</description>
