title: Datasets in CSV format
---

PRU provides some relevant datasets in CSV format (compressed using [bzip2][bzip2]):

The filename convention we adopted is as follows:

> `<dataset group>_<YYYY>.csv.bz2`

where
> `<dataset group> = <dataset>_<group>`

The datasets made available are:

* Daily en-route delays: `ert_dly`
    * [ANSP][ansp] group (see [list of ANSP's considered by PRU][ansps]): `ansp`
    * Country FIR group: `fir`

* Horizontal Flight Efficiency: `hfe`
    * Entity type can be `State (FIR)` or `FAB (FIR)	`

* Airport Arrival ATFM Delays: `apt_dly`

For example `ert_dly_ansp_2012.csv.bz2` refers to en-rote delays dataset with ANSP breakdown for year 2012.
