<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <em>actual taxi-out time</em> of a flight is the time elapsed between the off-block
time of this flight and its take-off time.</p>
<p>The <em>unimpeded taxi-out time</em> is the taxi-out time in non congested conditions
at airports. The unimpeded taxi-out time is used in the calculation of the
<a href="%3C/reference/definition/additional_taxi-out_time/" title="Additional Taxi-out Time definition">additional taxi-out time</a>.</p>
<p>This technical note describes the methodology used in order to calculate the
unimpeded taxi-out time.</p>
</div>
<div id="general-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>General approach</h2>
<p>The computation of the unimpeded taxi-out time is based on the statistical
analysis of flights in non congested conditions.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether a flight is unimpeded or not, its <em>congestion
level</em> is computed as the number of preceding movements (arrivals and
departures) that occur between the off-block of the flight up to its own
take-off.</p>
<p>The graphic here below illustrates the evolution of the actual taxi-out time as
a function of the congestion level. In this picture, the range between the first
quartile (bottom bar of each rectangle), third quartile (top bar) and the median
(medium line) is depicted for each level of congestion.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:saturationlevel"></span>

</p>
</div>
<p>As shown in this figure, as soon as a certain level of congestion is reached (at
the inflection point of the curve), the actual taxi-out time increases linearly
with the level of congestion (red line passing through the origin). Beyond that
inflection point, the actual taxi-out time is directly proportional to the
number of movements ahead. At a low level of congestion (before the inflection
point), the actual taxi-out time tends to be constant (horizontal red line).
This constant actual taxi-out time is considered to be the unimpeded taxi-out
time required by any flight to taxi out and take off. The intersection between
the two red lines corresponds to the <em>saturation level</em>.</p>
<p>The greater the level of congestion compared to the saturation level, the
greater the likelihood of a flight’s being delayed due to traffic ahead.
Therefore, to ensure that a flight is unimpeded, its congestion level needs to
be sufficiently small compared to the saturation level. However, it needs to be
ensured that the flight sample is big enough to produce a robust estimate of
unimpeded ASMA time. Considering a flight as unimpeded if its congestion level
is smaller than 50% of the saturation level has proved to be a good compromise
between this two conflicting facts.</p>
<p>Night flights may be subject to special procedures that are not representative
of daytime operations. Therefore flights between 6:00 and 22:00 only are used
for the calculation of unimpeded taxi-out time.</p>
<p>A different unimpeded taxi-out time is determined for each combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>departure runway; and,</li>
<li>departure stand (or group of stands);</li>
</ul>
<p>Although unimpeded taxi-out time is relatively static in time, regular checks
are made to ensure that it remains representative of the operations for the
airport under consideration. In case a change of unimpeded taxi-out time is
detected, the causes of that change (new procedure implementation, change in use
of infrastructure) are investigated. When required, new unimpeded times are
calculated. However, because this method is based on statistical analysis of the
actual taxi-out time, a period of several months after the change is required
before new robust unimpeded taxi-out times can be established.</p>

<p>Actual taxi-out time depends on the distance between the departure stand and the

<h4>Evolution of the additional taxi-out time with the congestion level</h4>
<p>In order to be able to consolidate in a single graph for a given airport
with different groups (departure stand and departure runway) and different
saturation levels the data has to be normalised.</p>
<p>For this reason a congestion index is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{congestion index}  = 100 * \frac{\text{congestion level}}{\text{saturation level}}
\]</span></p>
<p>By construction, a value of 100 always corresponds to saturation independent
of the departure stand or runway used.</p>
