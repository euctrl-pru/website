The Basic Load Index (BLI) and the [Peak Load Index (PLI)]({{< relref "references/acronym/pli.md" >}}) were defined as indicators that enable to compare [airport capacity utilisation]({{< relref "references/methodology/airport_capacity_utilisation.md" >}}).

Schinwald/Hornung (2014) describe a procedure to quantify the level of capacity utilisation comparing two characteristic throughput values.
The BLI measures how much of the available capacity is used across the majority of the operating conditions.
The [PLI)]({{< relref "references/acronym/pli.md" >}}) is a measure for the time the airport operates traffic peaks.




An indicator which assesses how much of the available capacity at an airport is already used.
