The Route Availability Document is a flight-planning document, which integrates
both structural and [ATFCM][atfcm] requirements, geographically and vertically,
following an appropriate [collaborative decision making][cdm] process between
the [network manager][nm] and the operational stakeholders.
It is a 'central' source of airspace utilisation rules and availability
defined and communicated by the ANSPs, 56 days before the start of the
concerned Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) cycle.

It facilitates flight planning in order to improve
Air traffic Flow and Capacity Management while allowing aircraft operators'
flight planning flexibility.

It also enables ANSPs to maximise capacity and reduce complexity by defining
restrictions that prevent disruption to the organised system of major traffic
flows through the congested areas with due regard to aircraft operators
requirements.
