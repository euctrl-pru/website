Instrument flight rules (IFR) is one of two sets of regulations governing all
aspects of civil aviation aircraft operations; the other is visual flight
rules (VFR).

Instrument flight rules  are rules and regulations to govern flight
under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe.
IFR flight depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the flight deck,
and navigation is accomplished by reference to electronic signals.
