The EUROCONTROL definition of “just culture”, also adopted by other European
aviation stakeholders, is a culture in which “front line operators or others
are not punished for actions, omissions or decisions taken by them that are
commensurate with their experience and training, but where gross negligence,
wilful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated.”
