Cross-Border Arrival Management, also referred to as Extended Arrival Management,
is an operational procedure which aims to improve and optimise arrival management
operations for major airports.

The aircraftâ€™s holding time at congested airports is cut by reducing their
cruising speed during the final en-route phase of flight, several hundred
miles away from the airport.  In doing so, flight efficiency is increased
by reducing the overall fuel burn and CO2 emissions.
Less airborne congestion in terminal areas will also contribute to improving
operational safety by reducing pilot/ controller workload and to reducing noise
for the communities living beneath the stacks.
