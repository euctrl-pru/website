IFPS collects, processes and distributes flight plans covering part of the ICAO EUR
Region known as the IFPS Zone (IFPZ).

IFPS consolidates the flight plans of the Network Manager area of operations (IFPZ)
into a single repository, thus maximising the consistency of flight data available
operationally.
