# {{ page.title }}

An approach to smooth sector workloads by reducing traffic peaks through short-term application of minor ground delays, appropriate flight level capping and exiguous rerouting to a limited number of flights.
Short-term ATFCM measures (STAMs) can reduce the complexity of anticipated traffic peaks. FMPs analyse the associated lists of flights to anticipate ATC workload and identify actions to be taken in order to reduce the traffic complexity generated by those flights.
