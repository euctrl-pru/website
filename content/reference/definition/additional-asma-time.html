<p>The Additional ASMA time is the difference between the actual ASMA transit time and the unimpeded ASMA time calculated for non-congested conditions.</p>

<p>Let</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math display">\[c\]</span>, a combination of aircraft class, ASMA sectors and arrival runway, as described in the technical note for unimpeded ASMA time,</li>
<li><span class="math display">\[f(c)\]</span>, a flight characterised by a combination <span class="math display">\[c\]</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math display">\[AcASMA(f(c))\]</span>, the actual ASMA transit time for a flight <span class="math display">\[f(c)\]</span>, i.e. the elapsed time between the last entry of the flight <span class="math display">\[f(c)\]</span> in its ASMA sector and its actual landing time (ALDT),</li>
<li><span class="math display">\[UASMA(c)\]</span>, the unimpeded ASMA time for a combination <span class="math display">\[c\]</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>additional ASMA time</em>, <span class="math display">\[AdASMA(f(c))\]</span>, is calculated for each flight f(c) as the difference between the actual ASMA transit time AcASMA(f(c)) of the flight and the unimpeded ASMA time UASMA(c):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
AdASAM(f(c)) = AcASMA(f(c)) - UASMA(c)
\]</span></p>
<p>The additional ASMA time, <span class="math display">\[AdASMA(c)\]</span>, for a given combination <span class="math display">\[c\]</span> is the average of the additional ASMA time, <span class="math display">\[AdASMA(f(c))\]</span> of all the flight <span class="math display">\[f(c)\]</span> characterised by that combination <span class="math display">\[c\]</span>.</p>
<p>The additional ASMA time, <span class="math display">\[AdASMA\]</span>, for a given airport is the weighted average of the additional ASMA time, <span class="math display">\[AdASMA(c)\]</span>, for all the combinations <span class="math display">\[c\]</span> at that airport with their probability of occurrence.</p>
