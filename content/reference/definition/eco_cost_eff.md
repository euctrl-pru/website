The quality of service provided by ANSPs has an impact on the efficiency of aircraft operations. The service 
quality related costs need to be taken into consideration for a full economic assessment of [ANSP][ansp] performance. 

The quality of service associated with ATM/CNS provision by ANSPs is, for the time being, assessed only 
in terms of [ATFM delays][atfm_delay], which can be measured consistently across ANSPs, can be attributed 
to ANSPs, and can be expressed in monetary terms. The indicator of “economic” cost-effectiveness is therefore 
the ATM/CNS provision costs plus the costs of ATFM delay, all expressed per [composite flight-hour][comp_hr].
