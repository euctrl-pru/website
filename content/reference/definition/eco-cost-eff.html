<p>The quality of service provided by ANSPs has an impact on the efficiency of aircraft operations. The service quality related costs need to be taken into consideration for a full economic assessment of <a href="%7B%7B%20%22/references/acronym/ansp.html%22%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.baseurl%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.url%20%7D%7D" title="ANSP">ANSP</a> performance.</p>
<p>The quality of service associated with ATM/CNS provision by ANSPs is, for the time being, assessed only in terms of <a href="%7B%7B%20%22/references/definition/atfm_delay.html%22%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.baseurl%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.url%20%7D%7D" title="ATFM delay">ATFM delays</a>, which can be measured consistently across ANSPs, can be attributed to ANSPs, and can be expressed in monetary terms. The indicator of “economic” cost-effectiveness is therefore the ATM/CNS provision costs plus the costs of ATFM delay, all expressed per <a href="%7B%7B%20%22/references/definition/composite_flight_hour.html%22%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.baseurl%20%7C%20prepend:%20site.url%20%7D%7D" title="Composite flight hour">composite flight-hour</a>.</p>
