<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p><strong>KEA</strong> is a key performance indicator measuring the level of horizontal en-route flight inefficiency in actually flown trajectories over a period of 12 months.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note that the values are NOT monthly averages but the average over the entire 12 months period preceding the last day of the month</em></strong></p>
<p>In order to smooth out the influence of unusual events, the ten best days and the ten worst days (for each measured area) are excluded from the computation.</p>
<p>The key performance indicator is used in the Single European Sky (SES) Performance Scheme.</p>
