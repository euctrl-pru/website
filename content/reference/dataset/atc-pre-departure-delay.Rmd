## Data description

The
[ATC pre-departure delay](/reference/definition/atc-pre-departure-delay/)
is a proxy for ATC induced delays at the departure stand to avoid queuing at the
departure runway.

The data is based on
[IATA delay code 89](/reference/definition/iata-code-89/)
[see [@iata:delaycodes] ] which, besides delays caused by
local ATC constraints, also includes delays due to late push-back approval and some other
reasons which may introduce a certain level of bias.
Work is in progress to allow for a better identification of the different causal factors.
