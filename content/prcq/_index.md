In the first nine months of 2018, air traffic in the EUROCONTROL area [(ESRA08)][esra08] grew on average by 3.4% which corresponds to 986 additional flights per day. On 7 September 2018, the network passed the 37 thousand flight barrier which was the highest level of traffic ever handled on one day. <br>

Average daily en-route service units (SU) continued to grow at a higher rate than flights (+6.6%) between January and September 2018.  

All [Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs)][ansp] showed an increase in traffic compared to 2017 (Jan-Sep). In absolute terms, DHMI (Turkey), ENAIRE (Spain), ENAV (Italy), DFS (Germany), and Bulatsa (Bulgaria) showed the highest growth in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.

Average en-route ATFM delays doubled in 2018 compared to the first nine months in 2017 which gives reason for concern and immediate action. 

The main drivers of the substantial increase in 2018 were en route ATFM regulations attributed to ATC Staffing [S], adverse weather [codes W,D], and ATC Capacity [C]. Compared to 2017 there was also a significant increase in ATFM delays (ATC disruptions) due to ATC industrial action in France. 

Overall, 13.7% of the controlled flights in the EUROCONTROL area were affected by ATFM delays in the first three quarters of 2018. By far the main share (78.2%) were delayed by en-route ATFM regulations. Compared to 2017 (Jan-Sep), the share of flights affected by en-route ATFM delays increased by 4.6 percent points to 10.7%. <br>At the same time, the share of flights affected by <a href='{{"/prcq/ops-airport.html"| prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}'>airport ATFM delays</a> decrease1d slightly from 3.2% in 2017 to 3.0% in 2018 (Jan-Sep).

Average en-route delay per flight was highest in France (2.13 min), followed by DFS/Germany (1.87 min), Cyprus (1.29 min) and Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre/MUAC (0.95 min). 

Horizontal en route flight efficiency in the first three quarters of 2018 remained at the level observed in 2017. 








##  <img src="/images/prcq-operations-airport.png" width="40" height="40" alt="Operations at Airports"> [Operations Airport][ops_apt]

Amsterdam remained the airport with the highest number of commercial movements in the EUROCONTROL area in 2018 (Jan-Sep).<br>

With an increase of more than 100 additional daily flights, Frankfurt (FRA) showed the highest growth in absolute terms, followed by Antalya, Athens and Madrid. 
<br>
Seven of the top 30 airports showed a decrease in traffic between January and September 2018 with Dusseldorf, Manchester and Stockholm reporting the most notable traffic reductions compared to the same period in 2017.  

Average airport ATFM delays at the top 30 European airports decreased from 1.28 to 1.13 minutes per arrival between January and September 2018. The most notable improvement was observed for Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport (SAW) where ATFM arrival delay reduced by 5.5 minutes on average. Amsterdam and London Gatwick airport also showed a notable improvement compared to the same period in 2017. <br>
At the same time, average arrival ATFM delays per arrival increased by more than 1 minute at Lisbon (LIS) and Barcelona (BCN). 

[Additional ASMA time][asma_add] at the top 30 airports decreased compared to the first nine months of 2017. Contrary to this positive trend, the average [additional taxi-out time][tx_out_add] increased at the top 30 airports from 3.7 minutes to 4.1 minutes per departure (excluding the two Istanbul airports and Antalya for which no data was available).
