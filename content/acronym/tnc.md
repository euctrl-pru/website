Given the risk for potential misunderstanding, it is useful to differentiate between Terminal ANS charges (also called “TNC” for terminal navigation charges) and “Airport charges”, which typically include landing, passenger, cargo, parking and hangar, and noise charges, and are covered by the EU Directive on airport charges (Directive 2009/12/EC).
