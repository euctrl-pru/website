The Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System is used to compare traffic demand
with the available capacity of a certain air traffic control ([ATC][atc])
sector.
It is a key enabler of the air traffic flow and capacity management
([ATFCM][atfcm]) services during tactical operations (on the day of the flight)
and pre-tactical operations (from 1 to 6 days before the flight is airborne).

The ETFMS system has two main functions:

* Calculation of traffic demand in every sector of the NM area of
  operations, using the flight plan information received from the
  aircraft operators (AOs) via the initial flight plan processing
  system (IFPS)

* Calculation, via Computer-assisted slot allocation (CASA), and distribution
  of the departure slots.
