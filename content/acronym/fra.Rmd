FRA refers to a  specified airspace within which users may freely plan
a route between a defined entry point and a defined exit point,
with the possibility to route via intermediate (published or unpublished)
way points, without reference to the ATS route network,
subject to airspace availability.
Within this airspace, flights remain subject to air traffic control.
