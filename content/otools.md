Following the successful [vertical flight efficiency workshop in November 2018][vfews],
the PRU has developed online tools enabling interested stakeholders to get tailored
reports upon request.

* **Vertical flight efficiency at airports (CCO/CDO)**
    
    The tool developed by the PRU provides customised reports on vertical flight efficiency
    during climb (CCO) and descent (CDO) at airports.
    The electronic reports are free of charge.
    Just click on the link below and enter your name, email address and the ICAO code
    of the airport and we will send you the electronic report within 24 hours by email.<br>

* **Vertical en-route flight efficiency**

    This tool provides you with customised reports on vertical en-route flight efficiency for a specific airport pair and
    [AIRAC cycle](https://www.nm.eurocontrol.int/RAD/common/airac_dates.html).
    The electronic reports are free of charge. Once you have entered your name,
    email address and the ICAO codes of the airport pair and AIRAC cycle,
    we will send you the electronic report within 24 hours by email.<br>
