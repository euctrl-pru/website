<h1>Conceptual model</h1>
<div id="what-we-ideally-would-like-to-measure" class="section level2">
<h2>What we ideally would like to measure</h2>
<p>On the conceptual level, the indicator aims to address the operational penalty associated with techniques used to maximize runway utilisation for inbound traffic flows at an airport, i.e. the accumulation of additional approach time resulting from speed control, path stretching and circling in the vicinity of the airport (use of holding patterns/stacks).</p>
</div>
<div id="concept-of-runway-optimisation" class="section level2">
<h2>Concept of runway optimisation</h2>
<p>When aircraft cannot fly unimpeded 4D trajectories, there are generally three places at which queuing takes place, as illustrated in the Figure <a href="#fig:adasma-01">1</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>At the departure stand (pre-departure queuing to optimise network performance)</li>
<li>At the departure runway (take-off queuing, e.g. runway holding)</li>
<li>In the arrival terminal airspace (arrival queuing in the Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area or ASMA, using speed control, stacks, holding, extension of approach path etc.)</li>
</ol>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:adasma-01"></span>
<img src="/images/adasma-01.png" alt="Outbound and Inbound Traffic Queues from a Flight Phase Perspective." width="500px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Outbound and Inbound Traffic Queues from a Flight Phase Perspective.
</p>
</div>
<p>Uncertainty of approach conditions (e.g. pilot performance, landing clearance time, approach speed, wind conditions) makes traffic supply to runways a stochastic phenomenon.</p>
<p>In order to ensure continuous traffic demand at runways and maximise runway usage, a minimum level of queuing is required. A certain extent of arrival queuing in airspace is necessary to allow arrival management (sequencing and metering) to optimise runway utilisation when demand is at or near the operational capacity.</p>
<p>However, additional time in holding is detrimental to operations efficiency, fuel consumption and environment. Therefore, a trade-off exists between approach efficiency and runway throughput.</p>
<p>Optimisation of the runway utilisation may require:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Re-sequencing the take-off/ landing order at the runway (first come is not first served), and</li>
<li>buffering a sufficient number of aircraft in the queue to be able to fine tune the metering (to optimise the separation of aircraft released from the queue to the runway.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases some aircraft will suffer a certain penalty in terms of queuing time. Higher runway utilisation targets may require higher levels of departure (take-off) queuing in the manoeuvring area and arrival queuing in airspace. This effect can be reduced if aircraft are already delivered to the queue in the right sequence and at the required time intervals.</p>
<p>To reduce cost and environmental impact, the departure and arrival queuing time should be kept to the minimum needed to achieve the selected runway utilisation objectives. If possible, any departure and arrival delay that is needed for other reasons than sequencing and metering should therefore be absorbed at the departure stand through ATFM delays and local ATC pre-departure delay. If this is done properly, then measuring outbound and inbound queuing time allows assessing the “operational cost” associated with sequencing and metering in function of the selected runway utilisation objectives.</p>
</div>
<div id="conceptual-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Conceptual approach</h2>
<p>The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the management of the arrival flow, understood as the average arrival runway queuing time on the inbound traffic flow, during periods of congestion at airports.</p>
<p>Performance in terms of additional ASMA time is monitored on the basis of regular reporting in comparison to a nominal reference. Based on regular reporting, metrics are derived for the respective reporting month. The current measurements are compared to a nominal reference to address the level of efficiency. The reference is derived from the statistical analysis of a reference period sample. This approach is depicted in Figure <a href="#fig:adasma-02">2</a>. Based on regular reporting, metrics are derived for the respective reporting month. The current measurements are compared to a nominal reference to address the level of efficiency. The reference is derived from the statistical analysis of a reference period sample.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The indicator is defined, see Equation <a href="#eq:AcASMA">(1)</a>, as the difference between the ASMA transit time (actual ASMA time) and the unimpeded ASMA time, based on ASMA transit times in periods of low traffic.</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:AcASMA">\[
\begin{equation} 
textrm{Actual ASMA Time} = textrm{Unimpeded ASMA Time} + textrm{Additional ASMA Time}
\tag{1}
\end{equation} 
\]</span></p>
<p>The unimpeded reference time is determined based on a statistical analysis of historic data observed at the airport, averaged for groupings of similar flights. The additional ASMA time is a measure for the extent of which the actual ASMA time exceeds the unimpeded reference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="logical-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Logical model</h1>
<p>This section describes the underlying logical modelling and drives the implementation of the additional ASMA time algorithm.</p>
<div id="assumptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The purpose of the <strong>additional ASMA time</strong> indicator is to provide an approximate measure of the <strong>average inbound queuing time</strong> on the inbound traffic flow, during times that the airport is congested.</p>
<p>The calculation of this indicator is based on generalised ASMA area defined around an airport. Aircraft are subject to the management of the arrival flow upon entering the ASMA area. Accordingly, the time spent within the ASMA area, i.e. the time elapsing between entering the ASMA area (actual ASMA entry time, ET) and the actual landing time of an arriving flight (ALDT). The generalised ASMA area is defined by a cylinder of radius 40NM around the airport extending to unlimited in terms of altitude.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:adasma-03"></span>
<img src="/images/adasma-03.png" alt="Conceptual approach for Additional ASMA Time." width="450px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Conceptual approach for Additional ASMA Time.
</p>
</div>
<p>Actual ASMA time refers to the period between the point in time when the aircraft enters the ASMA cylinder for the last time (‘entry time’) and the landing time. This ensures a consistent measurement for the inbound flow in the 40 NM around an airport. The additional time is measured as the average additional time beyond the unimpeded ASMA time, which is a statistically determined reference time based on actual ASMA times in periods of low traffic demand.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The indicator is currently defined for a radius of 40 NM to allow for comparability across Europe. For monitoring purposes, a supporting metric considering a radius of 100NM is calculated by PRU (the 40/100NM positions and timestamps are calculated from data feeds the Network Manager receives from member states.)</p>
<p>This indicator excludes influence of the following factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Impact of noise management and terrain clearance aspects: the same effects are included in both the impeded and unimpeded transit times; therefore this does not show up in the additional time which is the difference between impeded and unimpeded.</p></li>
<li><p>Effect of runway friction deteriorations: periods with such conditions are excluded. The calculation algorithm does not explicitly take any weather conditions into account.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="grouping-of-flights" class="section level2">
<h2>Grouping of flights</h2>
<p>To reduce the number of combinations of unique entry points and arrival runway, arriving flights entering the ASMA area within certain limits are grouped together. The clustering is based on observed arrival flows (i.e. crossing of flown trajectory with the ASMA cylinder).</p>
<p>The result of this clustering yields the <strong>ASMA sectors</strong> and may not be confused with the actual TMA or approach sectors around the airport. Each ASMA sector covers a major arrival flow, and the extent of the sector is based on visualization of arrival radar tracks (see Figure <a href="#fig:adasma-sectors">4</a>) and the aforementioned entry points.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:adasma-sectors"></span>
<img src="/images/asmasectors.jpg" alt="ASMA sectors and bearing." width="450px" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4: ASMA sectors and bearing.
</p>
</div>
<p>The indicator is first calculated at disaggregated level, i.e. per comparable <strong>grouping</strong> of flights with the same combination of <strong>ASMA sector</strong>, <strong>landing runway</strong> and <strong>aircraft class</strong>. Each grouping of flights has an unimpeded reference associated.</p>
<p>Taking the weighted average of the values for all groups produces the ASMA additional time for the airport.</p>

</div>
<div id="logical-approach-to-unimpeded-asma-time-calculation" class="section level2">
<h2>Logical approach to Unimpeded ASMA Time calculation</h2>
<p>The unimpeded ASMA time for each flight is taken from the unimpeded reference tables. These are calculated by averaging the actual ASMA time for the unimpeded flights from a reference sample (e.g. one year worth of data). The basis of the algorithm is to determine which flights are unimpeded.</p>
<p>The unimpeded ASMA time corresponds to the ASMA time that an aircraft of a given triplet, aircraft type – entry sector – runway combination, would spend if no additional sequencing time would be added, i.e., if the operation would be unimpeded. The unimpeded times are calculated from a reference data set, and their values are constant for each triplet combination.</p>
<p>The process steps are described below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The flights with no data or with wrong data are filtered;</li>
<li>Actual ASMA time and congestion level are calculated per flight;</li>
<li>For each flight and flight groupings of same aircraft type – entry sector – runway combination, calculate the saturation level per grouping;</li>
<li>From these flights, determine which flights are unimpeded by comparing congestion level and saturation level, for each grouping of flights with a different AC – SEC – RWY combination;</li>
<li>The unimpeded time is calculated as the median of all flights in the grouping of combinations AC-SECRWY, for groupings that have at least 20 unimpeded flights. No unimpeded reference time is calculated for the groupings that have less than 20 unimpeded flights. Night flights are excluded.</li>

<p>ASMA (Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area) is defined as the airspace within a radius of 40NM around an airport. The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the average arrival runway queuing time of the inbound traffic flow, during times when the airport is congested.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the actual ASMA transit time per flight is calculated as the difference between the entry time at ASMA cylinder and ALDT.

<p>For each aircraft landing at airport A, the number of aircraft that landed in the previous 20 minutes is counted.</p>

Then, the arrival rate during this period is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>The numerator of the fraction is expressed as <span class="math inline">\(n – 1\)</span> to denote that the aircraft <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is excluded for the calculation of the rate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the arrival throughput for each flight <span class="math inline">\(f_{c_i}\)</span> is calculated as:</p>

<p>For example, for a flight landing at 07:04:00hrs, the first preceding arrival is observed at 06:45:04. The resulting rate base is hence 18:56 minutes. Assuming 9 arrivals would be observed in this window (without counting the flight 07:04:00 flight), this yields a (theoretical) hourly throughput of:</p>

28.52 \frac{\textrm{flights}}{\textrm{hour}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The peak hourly arrival throughput of the airport, <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span> , is calculated as the 90 percentile of all <span class="math inline">\(\text{hourly rate}\)</span> values in the reference sample</p>

<h3>Step 4: Identification of unimpeded flights</h3>
<p>To ensure that a flight is unimpeded, its congestion level needs to be sufficiently smaller than the saturation level. Departing flights are considered as non-congested, if their congestion limit is equal or below the saturation threshold.</p>
<p>However, it needs to be ensured that the data sample is big enough to produce a statistically relevant sample for the chosen stand/runway combination and robust estimate of the unimpeded time.</p>
<p>To limit the impact of any congestion effect (and to address the sample size), the saturation threshold is estimated as a fraction of the saturation level. This limitation is achieved with the definition of the congestion limit <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{cl}\)</span>, a constant defined in Step 3a.</p>
<p>Based on the previous outputs, the identification of the unimpeded flights is done: the saturation level, corrected with the congestion limit, is compared to the congestion level.</p>

<p>In order to derive statistically meaningful and representative unimpeded times per group, only those groupings with equal or more than 20 flights are retained in the calculation.

These groupings 𝑐𝑖 do not have unimpeded times (consequently, it is not possible to calculate additional ASMA time for those groupings).</p>
<p>Night flights are excluded from the calculation at this point, so only the flights taking off during day time are considered for the calculation of the reference unimpeded times. On the standard calculation day time is defined between 06:30 and 22:00 of airport local time. Calibration of day time definition may lead to different definition in some of the busiest airports (see section 5).</p>
<p>For the groupings <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> that have 20 or more unimpeded flights, the unimpeded time is defined as the median of the Actual ASMA Transit Time <span class="math inline">\(\text{AcASMA}(f_{c_i})\)</span>, of all unimpeded flights <span class="math inline">\(\text{fu}_{c_i}\)</span> belonging to the grouping of flights.</p>

<p>These times are aggregated in Unimpeded References Tables for the calculation of the additional ASMA time as described in Section 4.1.</p>
<p>Although unimpeded ASMA time constants for each 𝑐𝑖 are relatively static in time, regular checks are made to ensure that they remain representative of the operations for the airport under consideration (see section 5.2). In case a change of unimpeded times is detected, the causes of that change (i.e. new procedure implementation, change of TMA design) are investigated. When required, new unimpeded time constants are calculated. However, because the unimpeded time constants calculation method is based on statistical analysis of the Actual ASMA transit time, a period of several months after the change is required before new robust unimpeded times can be established.</p>

<h1>Calibration of model parameters</h1>
<p>This section describes the model parameters that need to be customized for every airport, and the approach used for obtaining and updating them.</p>

<div id="asma-sectors" class="section level2">
<h2>ASMA sectors</h2>
<p>For a given runway configuration, the ASMA transit time depends on the direction from which the ASMA cylinder is entered. For this reason, the ASMA cylinder is divided into so-called ASMA sectors. The ASMA sectors are defined according to a statistical cluster analysis of the distribution of the inbound traffic.

<div id="unimpeded-times" class="section level2">
<h2>Unimpeded times</h2>
<p>The base period for the calculation of Unimpeded times (which are constants for each one of the groupings) is the year 2011, but this can vary across the different airports.</p>
<p>Unimpeded times are calculated once, over 1 year, and they are kept in a static reference table.</p>
<p>As part of the manual quality analysis of the results, the unimpeded times are recalculated every month to investigate whether there are any changes in unimpeded times. Changes at the airport and the airspace design can have an impact on the unimpeded times. Only in the cases that the substantial changes are reported for an airport, the differences will be investigated with the particular airport. If the change is due to a change in the airport characteristics that require a new performance reference, the reference unimpeded times will be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>Because the unimpeded time constants calculation method is based on statistical analysis of the actual ASMA time, a period of three months after the change is required before new robust unimpeded times references can be established.</p>
<div id="example-of-unimpeded-times-recalculation" class="section level3">
<h3>Example of unimpeded times recalculation</h3>
<p>The following represents an example considering an airport XXXX with its reference unimpeded times based on the full year of 2011.</p>
<p>As part of the monthly values calculation, the unimpeded times will be recalculated each month (e.g. for June 2014) and compared with the “reference” ones (based on 2011).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the values are considered similar enough, the static values will be kept: the airport reference period will still be 2011. The validity of the reference unimpeded times based on 2011 will be extended to June 2014)</p></li>
<li><p>If a change is detected in the June 2014 results (the unimpeded times recalculated based on June 2014 are significantly different from the 2011 ones), the issue will be investigated and discussed with the airport, in order to decide which new reference to take. If, for example, the change was due to a new runway opened in June 2014, the new reference will be the following year: June 2014-June 2015. However, if the difference corresponds to a runway closure of 3 months, the reference would be modified only for the affected 3 months.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Two parameters can trigger the renewal of the unimpeded time reference for one airport, each month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number of flights that do not have unimpeded reference (are not in a grouping with more than 20 unimpeded flights) are more than 10% of the total traffic of the concerned month.</p></li>
