The [Performance Review Unit (PRU)](/about/) has developed 
an online ANS performance data portal covering all 41 EUROCONTROL Member States:

* to ensure that interested stakeholders in all Member States have relevant high quality information
  on Pan-European ANS performance readily available in a transparent, accurate, clear, complete and
  unbiased manner;
* to stimulate an informed dialogue between all stakeholders for the benefit of the entire aviation
  network; and,
* to further develop the ANS performance analysis framework and the understanding of key ANS
  performance issues.

Within the context of Single European Sky (SES), the PRU has developed a dedicated
[SES e-dashboard](http://www.eurocontrol.int/prudata/dashboard/rp2_2017.html)
for the European Commission which is a formal and official source of data in the context of the SES
legislation, supporting NSAâ€™s in their SES monitoring activities.
The PRU updates this data on behalf of the European Commission on a quarterly basis.
