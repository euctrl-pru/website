<p>The Additional ASMA time is the difference between the actual ASMA transit time and the unimpeded ASMA time calculated for non-congested conditions.</p>

<p>The <em>additional ASMA time</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c))\)</span>, is calculated for each flight <span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span> as the difference between the actual ASMA transit time <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AcASMA}(f(c))\)</span> of the flight and the unimpeded ASMA time <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{UASMA}(c)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\textrm{AdASAM}(f(c)) = \textrm{AcASMA}(f(c)) - \textrm{UASMA}(c)

<p>The additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(c)\)</span>, for a given combination <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the average of the additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(f(c))\)</span> of all the flight <span class="math inline">\(f(c)\)</span> characterised by that combination <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}\)</span>, for a given airport is the weighted average of the additional ASMA time, <span class="math inline">\(\textrm{AdASMA}(c)\)</span>, for all the combinations <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> at that airport with their probability of occurrence.</p>
