This is what needs to be checked for full migration to Hugo:

* ~~finish to port acronyms: from "n"~~
* ~~port definitions~~
* ~~bibliography via Rmd~~ but also check [this](https://github.com/mtbhomer/web-portfolio/blob/master/themes/mtbhomer-portfolio/layouts/research/single.html) for publication list solution. It shows as in [here](https://www.mtbhomer.com/research/)
* pagination of posts. Keep only the last 5 or so

* Improve `howbuilt`
* style header, fonts,...
* custom 404 page
