This is what needs to be checked for full migration to Hugo:

* re-add search box in nav
* paginatilast 5 or so
* sidebar menu navigation for PRU Quaterly, see Hugo dos in github
* style header, fonts,...
* anti-spammer subscriber
* fix table extent in data download page
* fix links to XLS files in data download table
* clean dashboard layout, i.e. google charst, pym.js,...
* fixed nav bar
* dataset HFE: fix Pym iframe height
* fix "APT DLY filter and CSV download" link, http://localhost:8000/reference/dataset/airport-arrival-atfm-delay/
  in http://localhost:8000/reference/dataset/airport-arrival-atfm-delay/
* should 'crt_ertfltsMM_15.js' be deleted?
* pages for filtered CSV download: do we move?
* consider using excerpt in yaml for list of studies (it gives a sort of summary of the thing)
* D3 logo. Keep only the D3 fancy logo in the template.
* Netlify HUGO_ENV for activating Google Analitics, see layouts/partials/footer.html



## New stuff

* generate yearly CSV for HFE, APT_DLY,... (see export<>.R scripts)
* investigate use of http://tachyons.io/
* use ggplotly for graphs
* check htmlwidgets: http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/ and blogdown
* Improve `howbuilt`
* check google tag manager, see Hugo's partial gtag.html
