<p>The PRU is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the performance of the Pan-European ANS system across a number of key performance areas.</p>
<p>As part of the EUROCONTROL Agency, the PRU supports the independent <a href="http://www.eurocontrol.int/ansperformance/">Performance Review Commission (PRC)</a> in running the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and executing the associated PRC work programme with the appropriate level of independence.</p>
<p>The PRU also provides support to the European Commission (EC) on the SES Performance and Charging Schemes.</p>
<p>In performing its tasks, the PRU maintains transparent working arrangements with service providers, airspace user organisations and the industry.</p>
<p>Although the PRU is independent, it is administratively reporting to the Directorate European Civil-Military Aviation (DECMA).</p>
