# {{ page.title }}

An operation, enabled by airspace design, procedure design and ATC
facilitation, in which an arriving aircraft descends continuously,
to the greatest possible extent, by employing minimum engine thrust,
ideally in a low drag configuration, prior to the final
approach fix/final approach point.
