The <a href="{{ "" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}/about/">Performance Review Unit (PRU)</a> has developed
an online ANS performance data portal covering all 41 EUROCONTROL Member States:<br>
 <ul>
  <li>to ensure that interested stakeholders in all Member States have relevant high quality information on Pan-European ANS performance readily available in a transparent, accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner;</li>
  <li>to stimulate an informed dialogue between all stakeholders for the benefit of the entire aviation network; and,</li>
  <li>to further develop the ANS performance analysis framework and the understanding of key ANS performance issues.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Within the context of Single European Sky (SES), the PRU has developed a dedicated <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/prudata/dashboard/vis/2018/">SES e-dashboard</a>
for the European Commission which is a formal and official source of data in the context of the SES legislation, supporting NSAâ€™s in their SES monitoring activities.
The PRU updates this data on behalf of the European Commission on a quarterly basis.
