Please note that software release 20.0 of the Network Manager on 04 April 2016 introduced a change to improve the accuracy of the ATFM delay calculation for operational purposes.
For more information on the the change in methodology <a href="{{site.url}}/references/methodology/ATFM_delay_calculation.html">click here</a>. 

## Data description

The [en-route ATFM delay](/references/definition/en-route_atfm_delay.html)
provides an indication of ATFM delays on the ground due to constraints en-route.

In Europe, when traffic demand is anticipated to exceed the available capacity
in en route centres or at airports, Air Traffic Control
([ATC](/references/definition/atc.html)) units may request the local Flow
Management Position ([FMP](/references/definition/fmp.html)) to instigate an Air
Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) measure, or
[regulation](/references/definition/regulation.html).
Aircraft expected to arrive during a period of congestion are given ATFM delay
at their departure airport, under the authority of the
Network Manager, in order to regulate the flow of traffic into the constrained
downstream en route sector or airport, thus ensuring safety.

The calculation of En-route ATFM delay is based on a well established and
commonly accepted algorithm and has been in use as a commonly agreed proxy for
en-route capacity shortfalls since 1999.

## ATFM delay computation

The ATFM delays are calculated as the difference between the estimated
take-off time calculated from the filed flight plan including updates and the
calculated take-off time allocated by the central unit of ATFM.

The reason for the regulation is indicated by the responsible Flow Management
Position (FMP).

The delay is attributed to the most constraining ATC unit.

*Please note that the delays caused by READY to Depart (REA) messages and ATFM slot 
extensions were included in ATFM delays until NM release 20.0. 
As of 4 April 2016, delays due to REA messages and slot extensions are not included 
any longer which reduces the amount of computed ATFM delay.*  

## Traffic computation

The number of flights is based on Flight Information Region (FIR) boundaries 
(which are not necessarily coincidental with the airspace controlled by the
respective ANSP).

## FAB definitions

The FAB level information is based on an aggregation of Flight Information
Regions (FIRs) (ENTITY_TYPE = FAB (FIR)).
