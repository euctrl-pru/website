## Data description

The additional taxi-out time is a proxy for the average departure runway queuing time on the
outbound traffic flow during congestion periods at airports.

It is the difference between the actual taxi-out time of a flight and a statistically determined
unimpeded taxi-out time based on taxi-out times in periods of low traffic demand.

When monitoring taxi-out performance at airports, it is important to note that the goal
is not to reduce taxi time to the unimpeded reference time - as this could negatively impact
on runway throughput - but rather to reduce additional taxi-out time and associated fuel burn
to the necessary minimum.

### Calculated Field(s)

\begin{align*}
\text{Average unimpeded taxi-out time} & = \frac{TIME\_TXO\_UNIMP\_2}{FLT\_TXO\_UNIMP\_2} \\
\text{Average additional taxi-out time} & = \frac{TIME\_TXO\_ADD\_2}{FLT\_TXO\_UNIMP\_2}
\end{align*}
