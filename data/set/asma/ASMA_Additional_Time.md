## Data description
The [additional ASMA time](/references/definition/additional_asma_time.html) is
a proxy for the average arrival runway queuing time on the inbound traffic flow,
during congestion periods at airports.

It is the difference between the actual [ASMA](/references/definition/asma.html)
time of a flight and a statistically determined
[unimpeded ASMA time](/references/definition/unimpeded_asma_time.html) based on
ASMA times in periods of low traffic demand.

When monitoring ASMA performance at airports, it is important to note that the
goal is not to reduce ASMA time to the unimpeded reference time - as this could
negatively impact on runway throughput - but rather to reduce additional ASMA
time and associated fuel burn to the necessary minimum.

### Calculated Field(s)

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Average additional ASMA time} & = \frac{TIME\_ASMA\_ADD\_2}{FLT\_ASMA\_UNIMP\_2}

$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Average unimpeded ASMA time} & = \frac{TIME\_ASMA\_UNIMP\_2}{FLT\_ASMA\_UNIMP\_2} 
\end{align*}
