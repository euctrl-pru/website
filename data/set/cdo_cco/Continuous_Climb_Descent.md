## Data description
This data provides the results of the analysis of vertical flight profiles during climb and descent at airports. 
The methodology is desto measure and observe vertical flight efficiency without highlighting specific reasons for the observed behaviour. More detailed case studies are needed to find out reasons for particular observations.
