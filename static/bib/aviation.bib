  abstract = {Significant efforts are underway to modernize global air traffic
              management systems. Flight efficiency is a major political
              design criterion. This paper addresses the identification and
              measurement of ATM related constraints on vertical flight
              efficiency with a focus on continuous descent operations.
              Efficiency of flight operations has become a key driver for
              identifying bottlenecks and constraints imposed by ATM on
              airspace user preferred flight trajectories. In particular,
              measures aiming at fuel-efficient operations attract a lot of
              attention. This paper reports on the work jointly performed by
              the FAA and EUROCONTROL to address vertical flight efficiency.
              Based on an empirical study of trajectory data for US and
              European airports, a vertical profile analysis algorithm has
              been developed considering research experiences and
              stakeholder consultations of both teams. This work was
              performed as the preparatory action of the joint US/Europe
              comparison report. The results include a joint and harmonized
              algorithm to describe the vertical trajectory profile and the
              initial definition of metrics for the performance measurement.
              This harmonized algorithm will be further be validated and
              refined as part of the US/Europe comparison report including a
              wider set of airports. Demonstrating the general feasibility,
              the algorithm will be further promoted for use in
              international performance activities under ICAO.},

                  of the joint study conducted by the Federal Aviation
                  Administration (FAA) and EUROCONTROL on behalf of the European
                  Union is to understand differences between the two ATM systems
                  in order to further optimise ATM performance and to identify
                  best practices for the benefit of the overall air transport
                  system. The analysis is based on a comparable set of data and
