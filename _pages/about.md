The PRU is an *independent* unit established by EUROCONTROL.

It is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the performance of the European
ATM System on behalf of its Member States.
The unit also supports the
[Performance Review Commission](http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/about-european-ans-performance-review) (PRC) and
makes recommendations to the PRC for performance improvements of the European
ATM System on the basis of thorough analyses.

The PRU has been tasked by the European Commission to develop a
[Single European Sky Performance Monitoring Dashboard](http://www.eurocontrol.int/prudata/dashboard/rp2_2016.html)
in support to NSA's for their monitoring activities during
[RP1]({{site.url}}/references/acronym/rp1.html) and
[RP2]({{site.url}}/references/acronym/rp2.html).

The SES Performance Monitoring Dashboard
is delivered to the European Commission on a quarterly basis and is
the formal and official source of data in the context of the SES
legislation.
The SES Performance Monitoring Dashboard covers only the FABs/Member States subject
to SES legislation.

The PRU Portal (this site) and its [Data Download](/data/) and
[Visualizations](/graphs/) sections cover all Eurocontrol Member States.
PRU Portal datasets are not to be used for the purpose of complying to SES
legislation, they have no formal status in that context (but they are
consistent with what submitted to SES Performance Monitoring Dashboard).
PRU Portal data generally provides higher degree of granularity both
geographical and/or temporal.

Our work is based on best practices and on specific theories and studies as
explained in the [Methodology]({{site.url}}/references/methodology/) section.

Finally the [Bibliography]({{site.url}}/references/bibliography.html) lists
relevant publications and web resources that support and complement our work.
