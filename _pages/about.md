The PRU is an *independent* unit established by EUROCONTROL.

It is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the performance of the European
ATM System on behalf of its Member States.
The unit also supports the
[Performance Review Commission](https://www.eurocontrol.int/node/1737) (PRC) and
makes recommendations to the PRC for performance improvements of the European
ATM System on the basis of thorough analyses.

The PRU has been tasked by the European Commission to support the Performance
Review Body (PRB) with data collection, analysis and data provision.

The [PRB Dashboard](http://www.eurocontrol.int/prudata/dashboard/rp2_2016.html)
is delivered by PRU to the European Commission/PRB on a quaterly basis and is
the formal and official source of data in the context of Single European Sky
(SES) legislation.
It covers only the FAB/Member States subject to SES legislation.

The PRU website (this site) and its [Data Download](/data/) and
[Visualisations](/graphs/) sections cover all Eurocontrol Member States.
PRU website datasets are not to be used for the purpose of complying to SES
legislation, they have no formal status in that context (but they are
consistent with what submitted to PRB Dashboard).
PRU website data generally provides higher degree of granularity both
geographical and/or temporal.

Our work is based on best practices and on specific theories and studies as
listed in the [Bibliography]({{site.url}}/references/bibliography.html) page.
